There are several default ways in which you can arrange and present products to your customers to highlight the ones you feel need the most attention. On this page you’ll learn:

- How to mark a product as featured
- Sort and Filter Products and Categories

To mark a product as featured, go to **Products > All Products** and select the **Star** in the featured column. Alternatively, select **Quick Edit** and then the **Featured** option. On the “Edit Product” page you can mark a product as featured from the [Catalog Visibility settings](https://woocommerce.com/document/managing-products/product-editor-settings/#setting-catalog-visibility-options-and-feature-status)

The options below give you the ability to quickly view certain kinds of products in the admin area, and customize the default order products will appear in your store. If you’re using a classic theme, there are additional options available via the [WooCommerce Customizer](https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-customizer/#shop-page). Block themes have more options to customize product display via the templates in the site editor.

In the admin area, use the **Filter** function to get a product count, view products by specific category, view products by specific type, see only which products are In Stock, Out of Stock, or On Backorder, or a combination of these.

1. Go to **WooCommerce >** **Products**.
2. Select a **Category**, **Product Type**, **Stock Status**, or any **combination** of the three.
3. Click **Filter**.

**Note:** When the site has fewer than 100 categories, the category filter field will appear as a dropdown. When the number of categories reaches 100, an input search will be used instead of a dropdown. Unlike the dropdown, input search will not show all categories, only categories that are tied to some product.

Sorting is different than Filtering, in that you can drag and drop products to re-order them. This sorted order is used as the default ordering of products in your shop. You can sort all products, or any subset of products, like a specific category of products, by filtering to a specific subset of products before dragging them to change their order.

1. Go to **WooCommerce >** **Products**.
2. Select **Sorting**.

You can now drag and drop products in an order to your liking.

To sort within a specific subset of products, filter the product list:

1. From the **WooCommerce > Products** screen, select a **Category**, **Product Type**, **Stock Status**, or any **combination** of the three.
2. Click **Filter**.
3. If you haven’t already, select **Sorting**.

Now you can drag and drop to sort products within a specific category, or other filtered selection.

**Note:** For your custom sorting to be visible to customers, **Default Sorting** needs to be selected in the Customizer at **Appearance > Customize > WooCommerce > Product Catalog**. [Read more here](https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-customizer/product-catalog/#default-product-sorting). The customizer is hidden If you are using a block theme that supports Full Site Editing, and no other plugins have registered customizer settings. However, you can access the URL directly: `https://example.com/wp-admin/customize.php`

A WooCommerce Product ID is sometimes needed when using shortcodes, widgets, and links to sort, filter, or display products. To find the ID, go to **Products**and hover over the product you need the ID for. The product ID number is displayed.

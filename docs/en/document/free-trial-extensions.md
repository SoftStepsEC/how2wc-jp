You can try selected WooCommerce Marketplace extensions for 30 days via free trial using an automatically-created personal demo site.

If you would prefer to try one out on your own site instead, all extension purchases are covered by our [30-day money-back guarantee](https://woocommerce.com/refund-policy/).

All you need for the demo site is a [WordPress.com account](https://wordpress.com/start/) — no domain name, hosting plan, or existing site/store necessary.

To set up a free WooCommerce test site with a trial extension(s) installed and activated, follow the steps below:

1. Navigate to the Marketplace product page of the extension you want to try.
2. Click the **View demo** button near the top-right of the page.

1. From the **Start testing…** popup that appears, click **Create my test site**.

1. Next, click **Log in** to connect your WordPress.com account to your free trial demo site. If an incorrect WordPress.com account is displayed, click **Sign in as a different user.**

1. You will be taken to the WP Admin dashboard of your newly-created TestWoo.com demo store . From here, you can view:
  - The number of days remaining in your 30-day trial, starting from the time of activation.
  - The name of the extension you opted to test.
  - A link to its documentation for help with setup and configuration.
  

1. From here, navigate to *Plugins*. You will notice that WooCommerce and your selected free-trial extension are both pre-installed and activated for you.
2. If you wish, you can also click the **Activate** link below the other extension names in this list to test compatibility with your trial extension and explore their features
3. Set up and configure each extension using their linked documentation. Enjoy!

**Note:** Your TestWoo.com demo site will be automatically deleted once your 30-day trial is complete.

We’re always looking to improve our features, and will add new extensions to the list on this page as they become available for free trials.

In the meantime, we offer a [30-day money-back guarantee](https://woocommerce.com/refund-policy/), so you can buy and try any WooCommerce Marketplace extension with confidence.

Free trial extensions are not eligible for help from the Woo Happiness team.

While our Happiness team **does not** offer support for extensions while they are on a free trial, Woo’s [30-day money-back guarantee](https://woocommerce.com/refund-policy/) allows you to buy and try any extension on your site with confidence — [with support included](https://woocommerce.com/support-policy/).

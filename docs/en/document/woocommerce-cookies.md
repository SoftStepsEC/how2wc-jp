A summary on cookies, and how WooCommerce uses cookies.

Cookies are small pieces of data, stored in text files, that are stored on your computer or other device when websites are loaded in a browser.

They are widely used to ‘remember’ you and your preferences, either for a single visit through a ’session cookie’ or for multiple repeat visits using a ‘persistent cookie’. They ensure a consistent and efficient experience for visitors, and perform essential functions such as allowing users to register and remain logged in.

Cookies may be set by the site that you are visiting, known as ‘first-party cookies; or by third parties, such as those who serve content or provide advertising or analytics services on the website, known as ‘third-party cookies’.

Both websites and HTML emails may also contain other tracking technologies such as ‘web beacons’, or ‘pixels’. These are typically small transparent images that provide us with statistics for similar purposes as cookies. They are often used in conjunction with cookies, though they are not stored on your computer in the same way. If you disable cookies, the web beacons may still load, but their functionality will be restricted.

Cookies are used by WooCommerce in a variety of ways.

Cookies depend on specific features that are enabled on a store. The cookies are active when a user interacts with one of these features or to allow admin functions to be performed from within the store’s dashboard (`/wp-admin`).

Details are provided in tables below, listing various cookies that are set for users of stores with the WooCommerce plugin installed.

#### Store front end:

No personal information is stored within these cookies.

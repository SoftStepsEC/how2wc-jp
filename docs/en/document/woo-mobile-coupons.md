Managing coupons in the WooCommerce Mobile App is similar to your desktop site. To learn more about coupon management, please see [Managing coupons in WooCommerce](https://woocommerce.com/document/coupon-management/).

To view, edit, or create a coupon in the mobile app, tap **Menu** > **Coupons**.

- From the **Coupons** page, search for a particular coupon by tapping the **magnifying glass** icon top-right, or scroll and select a coupon.
- Once you’ve selected a coupon, you can view its **status** (such as active or draft), along with a **discount summary**. This summary includes the total discount amount, whether free shipping is added, and which products, categories, or email addresses the coupon applies to.
- In the **Performance** section, you can see how many orders have used this coupon and the total discount it has generated.
- To share a coupon, tap the **vertical** **ellipses**/kebab icon (**⋮**) in the top-right corner. Press **Copy Coupon Code** to copy the discount code to your clipboard or **Share** to bring up your device’s standard share menu.

From the **Coupons** menu, click the **add/plus** (**+**) icon in the bottom-right corner to create a new coupon.

Currently, the mobile app allows you to create **three types of coupons**:

A percentage discount applies only to **selected products**. For example, if a cart contains three t-shirts at $20 USD each, the total is $60 USD. A 10%-off coupon would provide a discount of $6 USD.

This is a fixed total discount applied to the **entire cart**. For example, if a cart contains three t-shirts at $20 USD each, the total is $60 USD. A fixed discount coupon for $10 USD would provide a discount of $10 USD.

A fixed total discount applies to **selected products** only. Customers receive a set discount per item. For example, three t-shirts at $20 USD each with a coupon for $10 USD off provides a discount of $30 USD.

After selecting the type of coupon you wish to create, fill in the necessary information. (If you have any questions about these editable fields, please see [Creating/adding a coupon in WooCommerce](https://woocommerce.com/document/coupon-management/#adding-a-coupon).) Finally, tap the **Create** button at the bottom of the screen.

**Note:** Currently, only core WooCommerce coupon types (percentage discount, fixed cart discount, and fixed product discount) can be edited via the mobile app. Coupon types created by other extensions (e.g. WooCommerce Subscriptions) cannot be edited within the app.

To edit an existing coupon, select it from the **Coupons** menu.

Once the coupon is selected:

- Tap the **vertical** **ellipses**/kebab icon (**⋮**) in the top-right corner, and choose **Edit Coupon** from the dropdown.
- Make changes to the coupon. (If you have any questions about these editable fields, please see [Creating/adding a coupon in WooCommerce](https://woocommerce.com/document/coupon-management/#adding-a-coupon).)
- Once you’re finished, tap **Save** at the bottom of the screen.

If you’re using the Jetpack plugin to connect the mobile app to your site, ensure that the Jetpack connection is active and functioning correctly.

- For Storefront and its child themes, use the [Storefront Powerpack](https://woocommerce.com/products/storefront-powerpack/) or else you need to know CSS and custom style it.
- For Canvas:**Canvas > Settings > Header & Footer > Footer**
- For other themes: **Theme Settings > Footer Customization**. Check the boxes for Enable Custom Footer (Left) and (Right) to remove the default footer content. You can then optionally enter your own footer content in the Custom Text boxes.

title: Change to Use Terms and Privacy Policy – July 2020
url: https://woocommerce.com/document/privacy-update-jul-2020/
---

As of August 1, 2020, your agreement (the [WooCommerce Use Terms](https://woocommerce.com/terms-conditions/)) will no longer be with Bubblestorm Management (Pty) Ltd., and the company responsible for your personal information (as mentioned in our [Privacy Policy](https://automattic.com/privacy/)) will change.

If you reside in Australia, Canada, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Russia, and any countries located in the European continent, your agreement will be with **Aut O’Mattic A8C Ireland Ltd.**, which will be the primary controller of your personal information. If you reside anywhere else, it’s **Automattic Inc.** that you will contract with and that will be responsible for your personal information.

The agreement, our Privacy Policy, and our services **haven’t changed** — this is purely corporate housekeeping to make things simpler (for us).

Bubblestorm is the original parent company of WooCommerce – [we joined the Automattic family](https://href.li/?https://woocommerce.com/posts/woothemes-joins-automattic/) a few years ago, and these changes help formalize that. You may already be familiar with these entities if you have a WordPress.com account or have read through our Privacy Policy.

**Nothing** – it’s business as usual, and your store and WooCommerce.com account remain unaffected.

Privacy is critically important to us. For details of how we collect and store personal information, see our [Privacy Policy](https://automattic.com/privacy/).

To access a WooCommerce account, log in with your connected WordPress.com account credentials.

- If you have a WordPress.com account, but don’t remember the password, you can reset it by visiting the [Lost Password form](https://wordpress.com/wp-login.php?action=lostpassword) to start the password recovery process.
- If you need to create a WordPress.com or WooCommerce.com account, check out the [Log into WooCommerce.com with WordPress.com documentation](https://woocommerce.com/document/log-into-woocommerce-com-with-wordpress-com/) to get you started.

For further assistance with your account, please [contact us](https://woocommerce.com/contact-us/).

Please note that it’s **not possible to unsubscribe from important emails** about our relationship or our transactions (like the one you just received) as long as you have a WooCommerce.com account.

To unsubscribe from marketing emails, please click the Unsubscribe link at the bottom of any marketing message you’ve received.

WooCommerce.com accounts are now accessed via a WordPress.com login. For more information on how to close a WordPress.com account, visit the [Close My Account documentation](https://wordpress.com/support/close-account/) for more details. You can [close your WordPress.com account here](https://wordpress.com/me/account).

- If you want to keep your WordPress.com account, but delete your WooCommerce.com account, please [contact us](https://woocommerce.com/my-account/create-a-ticket/).
- If you haven’t connected WordPress.com or you are unable to access your account, please [contact us](https://woocommerce.com/contact-us) to help delete your account.

Do you still have questions and need assistance?

- [Get in touch](https://woocommerce.com/my-account/create-a-ticket/) with a Happiness Engineer via our Help Desk. We provide support for extensions developed by and/or sold on WooCommerce.com, and Jetpack/WordPress.com customers.

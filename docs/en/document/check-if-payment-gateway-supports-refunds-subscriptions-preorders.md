Payment methods can add support for certain features from WooCommerce and its extensions. For example, a payment method can support **refunds**, **subscriptions** or **pre-orders** functionality.

If the payment method documentation doesn’t clearly outline the supported features, you can often find what features are supported by looking at payment methods code.

Learn more about how to determine a gateway’s payment method support through code inspection in the [WooCommerce Developer Documenation](https://developer.woocommerce.com/docs/check-if-a-payment-method-support-refunds-subscriptions-or-pre-orders/).

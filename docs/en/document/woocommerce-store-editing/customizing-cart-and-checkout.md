The Cart and Checkout pages are a critical part of the shopping experience. The WooCommerce Cart and Checkout blocks provide customers with a seamless process for reviewing and finalizing their purchases in a low-friction way that maximizes conversion. Here we cover the templates and blocks associated with these pages along with details around upgrading to the new experience, customization, and configuration so their appearance and functionality match your store’s design and needs.

- [Templates](https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-store-editing/customizing-cart-and-checkout/#templates)
- [Cart Block](https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-store-editing/customizing-cart-and-checkout/#cart-block)
- [Checkout Block](https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-store-editing/customizing-cart-and-checkout/#checkout-block)
- [Mini Cart Block](https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-store-editing/customizing-cart-and-checkout/#mini-cart-block)

For WooCommerce stores started after the release of version 8.3 in November 2023, the Cart and Checkout blocks are the default experience, no setup is required to put the cart and checkout blocks in place, if your site is using a block theme you can get right to customizing the templates to fit your needs. No customization is required for the block cart and checkout to function.

If you’re upgrading an established store to use the blocks experience, or if you’ve removed the blocks and would like to switch back, expand the section below for directions on how to upgrade to the block cart and checkout!

Both the cart and checkout blocks can be transformed back to the classic version using the transform button in the [block toolbar](https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-store-editing/blocks/#block-toolbar).

There are two [templates](https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-store-editing/templates/) that control the display of the cart and checkout pages:

- The Cart page is controlled by the “ Page: Cart ” template.
  - The Cart template displays the items selected by the user for purchase, including quantities, prices, and discounts. It allows users to review their choices before proceeding to checkout.
  
- The Checkout page is controlled by the “ Page: Checkout ” template.
  - The Checkout template guides users through the final steps of the purchase process. It enables users to enter shipping and billing information, select a payment method, and review order details.
  

Access either of them by:

1. Navigating to **Appearance > Editor**from your site’s admin area,
2. Clicking **Templates,**
3. Selecting the template you’d like to edit,
4. Clicking the pencil icon to edit the template.

Both the cart and checkout page templates use the Store Notices block. The Store Notices block is where your shop displays shopper-facing notifications generated by WooCommerce or extensions. For example when an item is successfully added to the cart, the notification will show here. The store notices block can be added to any page or template of your site.

Since notifications of different types each have their own styling, there are no style settings for this block.

On the cart page you’ll see the Cart Block, it allows customers to view and manage the items they intend to purchase, offering options for updating quantities and removing products. The linked guide details the components of the Cart Block and provides steps for customizing its layout and settings to improve the user experience.

## Checkout Block

On the checkout page template you’ll see the Checkout Block, it’s where customers enter their shipping and payment information to complete their purchase. The following documentation outlines the elements of the Checkout Block and offers guidance on how to customize its settings to streamline the checkout process and meet your specific needs.

The Mini Cart Block gives customers a quick overview of their cart contents from any page on your store. The guide below explains the functionality of the Mini Cart Block and provides instructions for customizing its appearance and behavior to ensure a smooth and convenient shopping experience.

The cart and checkout flows make use of a few template parts that come included with WooCommerce. Learn more about [template parts](https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-store-editing/patterns-template-parts/#template-parts).

On the checkout page template, you’ll notice that instead of using the same header that is shown across the rest of your site, by default a simplified header is shown that only displays your site’s title. This is done on purpose to limit distractions from the checkout page and payment flow, and is an optimization that increases cart conversions and reduces abandoned carts!

Of course, you’re welcome to customize this header to your liking, or even replace it with the same header as you use across the rest of your site! However, we recommend sticking with a simple header that doesn’t contain links away from the checkout process.

The Mini-Cart block uses a template part to display the contents of the Mini-Cart. Check the [Mini-Cart page](https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-store-editing/customizing-cart-and-checkout/mini-cart/#editing-the-mini-cart-template-part) for more details on accessing and editing that template part.

Compatibility with the Cart and Checkout blocks for extensions on WooCommerce.com is marked on the product page. Look for the **Compatibility** section on any product to see if it’s compatible with the Cart and Checkout blocks.

If you use an incompatible extension which has[declared its incompatibility](https://developer.woocommerce.com/2023/11/06/faq-extending-cart-and-checkout-blocks/), a warning and a button to switch to the Classic Checkout with one click will appear in the settings sidebar when the Checkout Block or any of its inner blocks are selected.

Incompatible extensions may cause elements of the checkout to not be available as expected. For example if your payment gateway isn’t compatible with the block version of the checkout, it [may not appear as a payment option](https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-store-editing/customizing-cart-and-checkout/#seeing-there-are-no-payment-methods-available-at-checkout) on the checkout page.

If you are using a plugin that does not work as expected with the Cart and Checkout Blocks, please get in touch with its developers and let them know that you would like to use the new, block-based checkout. To assist developers in this effort, we have published[documentation](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-blocks/tree/trunk/docs#third-party-developers) and[resources](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-blocks/tree/trunk/docs#developer-resources) on integrating existing plugins with the Cart/Checkout Blocks and Store API.

If you have a third-party plugin that you believe is incompatible, you can contact the plugin developer and refer them to our guidance on[declaring compatibility with this new default](https://developer.woocommerce.com/2023/11/06/faq-extending-cart-and-checkout-blocks/). Plugin developers should mark their plugins as (in)compatible so users aren’t left to troubleshoot and figure that out themselves.

See our [primer on using Blocks](https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-store-editing/blocks/#using-classic-templates-placeholder-blocks-and-shortcodes) for more information about swapping back to classic templates if you encounter any incompatibility issues.

If you’re using the checkout block, and only have incompatible **payment gateways** installed and active, there won’t be any payment methods available at checkout, and so a warning is displayed on the checkout page.

In the [block settings sidebar](https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-store-editing/blocks/#block-settings) of the **Payment Options** inner block of the Checkout Block, you’ll see an option to switch back to the classic checkout with a single click.

Extensibility interfaces for the Cart and Checkout Blocks are still under active development. If you are developing extensions or customizations that integrate with the WooCommerce cart and checkout, we highly encourage you to[follow our progress](https://developer.woocommerce.com/category/roadmap-insights/) and provide feedback[on GitHub](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/discussions).

Extensions that use hooks to render additional markup in the cart or checkout pages – for example, custom checkout fields – usually require integration work to support the Cart and Checkout Blocks.

Found a plugin on WooCommerce.com that appears to be incompatible? Please[open an issue](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/issues/new/choose) to help us measure demand and prioritize extensibility work on our end.

title: Privacy considerations when using official payments extensions

If you choose to accept payments via a payment gateway like Stripe or PayPal, some of your — and your customers’ — data will be passed to the respective third party. This includes information required to process or support the payment, such as the purchase total and your customer’s billing information. We recommend that store owners disclose that they are sharing information with payment providers in their privacy policy.

This documentation outlines which data is stored and shared with a payment provider when a WooCommerce site uses [payment gateways offered on WooCommerce.com](https://woocommerce.com/product-category/woocommerce-extensions/payment-gateways/?categoryIds=1023&collections=product&page=1). When using a payment gateway, you are not sharing this information with WooCommerce.com.

Depending on which settings are enabled and which additional plugins/extensions are used, the specific information shared by your store will vary. We recommend consulting with a lawyer when deciding which information to disclose in your store’s privacy policy.

Information shared with a payment provider typically includes:

- Name
- Email
- Address
- Phone
- City/State/ZIP
- Unique payment identifier
- Payment provider identifier

Examining, refining, and streamlining our product offering is important to us at WooCommerce.com. We do this when we feel we managed to replace aging products with newer ones that have better design and more functionality and features, but also because only a bit of value remains in older products.

Retiring products ensures that everyone receives the best. Retirements also help us focus on and develop current and future products that our customers want most.

WooCommerce.com will continue to support the theme for the **duration of your subscription**, which will not qualify for renewal once it has expired. This support amounts to ensuring fatal errors and security fixes are implemented and does not extend to feature requests or customizations.

Should you spot a fatal error in the code and are using the latest versions of everything on your website, [visit us at the Help Desk](https://woocommerce.com/my-account/create-a-ticket/) and we’ll be happy to assist.

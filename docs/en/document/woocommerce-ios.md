The official**WooCommerce iOS App** is available for free from the Apple iTunes Store via [WooCommerce.app](https://woocommerce.app).

This guide walks you through setup, how to connect your store, and how to use the app.

- iOS 16 or above
- iPhone 8 or newer

The official**WooCommerce iOS App** also can be used with the iPad.

Your store should be either:

- Hosted on [WordPress.com](http://wordpress.com/) with a [WordPress.com Business or Commerce plan](https://wordpress.com/pricing/), or or
- self-hosted running WooCommerce 3.5 or higher.

*Jetpack is not required to use the app for self-hosted stores running on WordPress 5.6 or above. However, having the Jetpack plugin installed, connected, and activated enables notifications and can help your site work better with the app (more info on Jetpack at Getting Started with Jetpack .)*

To install the app, you can either:

- use your device to visit the Apple App Store, search for **WooCommerce by Automattic**, and install the app, **or**
- use your device to open this link and get started from there: [WooCommerce.app](https://woocommerce.app)

Our welcome screen will greet you after you have installed and launched the official WooCommerce iOS app. Select your login preference by entering your store address. The login process varies slightly depending on how your store is set up.

**Option 1:**Your store is hosted with WordPress.com or is a self-hosted store connected to Jetpack, either via the Jetpack Plugin or via one of the plugins that use the Jetpack Connection ([Google Listings & Ads](https://href.li/?https://wordpress.org/plugins/google-listings-and-ads/), [WooCommerce Payments](https://href.li/?https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce-payments/), [WooCommerce Shipping & Tax](https://href.li/?https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce-services/) or any of the Jetpack extensions).

In this case, the app will recognize your store is connected to Jetpack and prompt you to continue**with the WordPress.com** login flow.

- Type your WordPress.com account email address and tap Continue.
- Either type your WordPress.com password and tap **Continue**, or select **Get a login link by email.**
- If you have a choice of sites, tap to select your preference; otherwise, tap Continue.
- The **My Store** page loads, indicating your app is now connected to your WooCommerce store.

Alternatively, you can follow these steps to log in via QR code:

1. Enter an existing email address, and tap **Continue**.
2. Tap **Log in with magic link**.
3. Check your email on another device.
4. Tap **Scan QR code to log in** and scan the code in the email.

**Option 2:**Your store is self-hosted and you don’t have Jetpack or any of the Jetpack or WooCommerce extensions that use the Jetpack Connection.

- Enter your site address
- The app will recognize your site is not connected to Jetpack and will prompt you to add your username and password
- Enter the same username and password you use to log into your WP-Admin dashboard from a browser.

To disconnect the WooCommerce app from your store:

1. Tap the **Menu icon** on the navigation bar at the bottom-right of the screen
2. Select **Settings** at the top of the screen
3. Scroll down to the bottom of the **Settings screen**
4. Tap **Log Out**

You can manage any WooCommerce store using the app, provided it’s connected to your Jetpack account.

1. Tap the **Menu icon** on the navigation bar at the bottom-right of the screen
2. Tap the name of the****store at the top of the screen
3. Choose another store in your account
4. Tap **Continue** to complete the switch

Note: as of version 8.0, the app supports push notifications for *all* stores connected with the *same* Jetpack/WordPress.com account.

Multiple people with Administrator or Store Manager user roles can manage a store from their own devices. Each person will need to complete the following steps:

1. Log into the WooCommerce website via a browser
2. Go to **Jetpack → Dashboard** and then **Connections**
3. Select “**Link to WordPress.com**”
4. Log in with their WordPress.com account
5. Select **Jetpack Free Plan**
6. The respective user can now log into the app with their WordPress.com Account.

To allow Shop managers to view stats, go to **Jetpack → Settings → Traffic** and enable stats viewing.

The **My Store** page is the default view when launching the WooCommerce iOS app. It is one of four main sections, which are:

- **My Store –**a high-level overview of sales and top-performing products for this day, week, month, or year.
- **Orders** – search or filter existing orders or take payment for new ones.
- **Products**– search or filter existing products or add new ones.
- **Menu** – switch stores and access reviews, app [settings](https://woocommerce.com/document/settings-ios/), and more.

When using a tablet, you will also see a tab for **Point Of Sale (POS) Mode**. [You can learn more about POS Mode in our guide here](https://woocommerce.com/document/woo-mobile-app-point-of-sale-mode/).

If you can’t resolve problems yourself, please get in touch with the team in-app via the *Contact Support* button, as described above.

It could be one of two reasons.

- The list of available options displays only WordPress.com stores and self-hosted sites with WooCommerce and Jetpack plugins installed.
- WooCommerce 3.5 or higher is required to be installed and activated on the site you’re trying to connect to. If a store does not meet this requirement, an **Update to WooCommerce Required** message will display.

If the WooCommerce app isn’t responding as you’d expect, you can quit it and reopen it to resolve the issue. To do so, swipe up from the phone’s bottom edge and pause halfway up the screen. Swipe left or right to find the WooCommerce app as necessary, and then flick the WooCommerce app up (and off) at the top of the screen. You can then restart the WooCommerce app by tapping on the application icon.[](https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-ios/#section-18)

If you’re using the Jetpack plugin to connect the app to your site, make sure that the Jetpack connection is active and working correctly. You can verify some[known issues](https://jetpack.com/support/getting-started-with-jetpack/known-issues/)or try[reconnecting your site](https://jetpack.com/support/reconnecting-reinstalling-jetpack/).

If you’re still having difficulty, contact support from within the app by going to *Menu > Settings > Help & Support > Contact Support*.

**Scope of support:**

We are unable to provide support for customizations under our**Support Policy**. If you need to customize a snippet or extend its functionality, we recommend working with a [Woo Agency Partner](https://woocommerce.com/development-services/) or a WooCommerce developer on [Codeable](https://www.codeable.io/partners/woocommerce/?ref=qGefA6#tiers).

Add the code snippet below to your site via:

- A [child theme](https://developer.woocommerce.com/docs/how-to-set-up-and-use-a-child-theme/)‘s `functions.php` file, or
- A custom functions plugin, such as [Code Snippets](https://wordpress.org/plugins/code-snippets/).

**Do not add custom code directly** to your parent theme’s `functions.php` file; it will be overwritten/wiped entirely when you update the theme.

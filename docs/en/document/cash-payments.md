Merchants using the WooCommerce Mobile App can accept payments in person via card reader, Tap to Pay, or cash.

To **enable cash payments** through the mobile app:

1. Create a new order.
2. Select a product or add a custom amount.
3. Click **Collect Payment**. [](https://woocommerce.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/collect-payment.png?w=421)

5. Next, you’ll have the option to edit the amount being charged; this allows you to add a fee or apply a discount. You can also toggle the option to record the payment method in the order notes: [](https://woocommerce.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/addnote.png?w=422)
6. Once you receive the cash payment from your customer, tap the **Mark Order as Complete** button — the mobile app will create the order and change its status to **Complete**. You can then view this order and check the notes to see which payment method was used: [](https://woocommerce.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/notes.png?w=412)

If you’re using the Jetpack plugin to connect the mobile app to your site, ensure that the Jetpack connection is active and functioning correctly. [Review common issues](https://jetpack.com/support/getting-started-with-jetpack/known-issues/) or [reconnect your site](https://jetpack.com/support/reconnecting-reinstalling-jetpack/).

If you’re still having difficulty, contact support from within the app by going to *Menu > Settings > Help & Support > Contact Support*.

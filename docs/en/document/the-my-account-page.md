Customers who have an account with your store have access to **My account** — the central customer dashboard in a WooCommerce store. Here, customers can view past orders, and edit addresses and payment details. This guide provides an overview of what your customers can do via their account dashboard.

If a customer visits the *My account* page before logging in, a login prompt will appear:

After logging in, the customer sees the default *My account* **dashboard** and menu, with links to view their:

- Orders
- Downloads
- Addresses (billing and shipping)
- Payment methods
- Account details

They can also log out of their account via this menu.

The above image shows the default WooCommerce sections, but plugins and/or themes can also add sections here if required. For example, if using [WooCommerce Subscriptions](https://woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-subscriptions/), customers see an additional menu item for *Subscriptions*.

**Note:** For the *My account* menu to show up on the left as illustrated, **both** of the following must be true: 1. The *My account* page editor, set the template to **Default** (not **Full-width**). 2. In the Customizer, under **Layout**, select the option showing the narrow sidebar on the right.

The Orders section allows customers to access their order history. The order number, date, status, total, and actions available for each order, are available at a glance.

Customers can access a detailed view of each order by clicking either the linked order number or the view button to the right of the order. Additional actions may be available depending on the order status.

There are two additional buttons, **Pay** and **Cancel**, next to orders with either a *Failed* or *Pending payment* status to allow customers to return to it at a later time to pay.

- Clicking *Cancel* immediately cancels the order, and removes any further chance to either complete the order, or to quickly reorder it.

- The *Pay* button loads a simplified checkout page that requires only the payment details, which allows for a speedy order completion.

On the *Order details* page, customers can click the **Order again** button to reorder a previously **completed** order (i.e. it must be in *completed*status). The page is accessible via the linked order number or the *View* button.

The *Order again* button recreates the order items in the cart and sends the customer to the cart page, from there they can edit it or proceed to checkout.

For products purchased as part of a downloadable product, the **Downloads** section lists the product name, downloads remaining, expiry date, and provides a button to download attachments.

Customers can update their **Billing** and **Shipping****addresses from the *Addresses* section.

Edit icons reveal the respective sets of fields usually seen on the checkout page, including first and last names, address, company name, phone number, and email address for either billing or shipping.

The details in this section are for the purpose of billing and shipping only, and doesn’t impact the account details.

Under **Payment methods**, customers can find stored credit card details, provided a**[supported payment gateway](https://woocommerce.com/document/advanced-payment-gateway-features/#section-9) is activated in the store.

**Note:** The number of payment methods shown on this page currently depends on the **Blog pages show as most** setting under *Settings > Reading* in WP Admin.

In the **Account Details** section, a customer can update their personal info as it relates to their user account. The details include first and last name, and a display name, which is for the **accounts section** and **reviews** use.

Customers can also reset the account’s password in this section.

This link logs the customer out of their account and returns them to the dashboard section, which will once again show the login prompt.

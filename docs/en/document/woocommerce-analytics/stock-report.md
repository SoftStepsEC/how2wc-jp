The Stock Report provides insight into the inventory of your store. This report is only available on stores with stock management enabled.

The Stock Report allows you to filter the report by stock status. **Note:** Products that do not have stock management enabled are shown as `Out of Stock`.

This option loads the report for the stock status you have selected.

The report table allows sorting by all columns:

- Product
- SKU
- Status
- Stock

By default, the report shows stock ordered by stock quantity ascending.

Two of the report columns contain clickable entries:

- `Product` link opens the Products report for that coupon code
- `Status` link opens the WooCommerce Edit Product screen for that product

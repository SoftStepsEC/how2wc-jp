Before reaching out to support, you might want to review our helpful [WooCommerce Mobile App documentation](https://woocommerce.com/documentation/woocommerce/mobile/) to see if your question is already answered.

Our support documentation contains an extensive collection of up-to-date guides covering all aspects of our mobile app. We have screenshots and step-by-step walkthroughs to help you learn how to use the app and resolve any issues you may encounter.

If you have questions regarding the free, core WooCommerce plugin, please post a question and/or search for answers in the [official support forum on WordPress.org](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/woocommerce/). Many of our team members help out there as well.

The forum is an excellent place to get support. Our support staff (AKA Happiness Engineers) are active members there, and many volunteers are ready and willing to help as well. Most forum volunteers are veteran WooCommerce users who can help with most questions.

Before posting your request, please first use the search feature at the top of the forum landing page to locate previous discussions that could solve your problem.

If you are having issues that are specific to the Woo Mobile App and cannot find an answer in our documentation, please fill out our contact form to reach our support team from within the app by going to *Menu > Settings > Help & Support > Contact Support*. Rest assured that we’ll respond to you as soon as possible.

We answer all requests in the order in which they are received. We try hard to answer all support requests. If you have not yet received an answer to your question, please be patient — don’t submit a duplicate request, as this will delay our reply.

We are more than happy to answer questions related to the Woo Mobile App. However, some things fall outside of what we can help with, including but not limited to:

- Help with third-party extensions/plugins, themes, and tools not supported by the app.
- Users not using the latest app version available on the app stores.
- Help with anything that is not related to the Woo Mobile App.

While we try not to put too many restrictions on supporting our customers, please be aware that you’re interacting with a real person. Our Happiness Engineers are here to help and appreciate a positive and polite tone. Any abusive language will not be tolerated.

We do not offer phone support, as many issues we discuss require frequent references to web links and code. That is much easier to do using written forms of communication. While we are unable to call you, we are happy to support you through our numerous other channels. Thank you for your understanding!

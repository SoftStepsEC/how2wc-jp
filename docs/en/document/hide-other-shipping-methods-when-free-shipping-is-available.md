As of WooCommerce version 9.9, a new setting has been introduced to hide other shipping methods when “Free Shipping” is available. You can navigate to **WooCommerce > Settings > Shipping > Shipping Settings** and enable the **“Hide shipping rates when free shipping is available”**option**.** This new setting eliminates the need for snippets or plugins, offering a built-in solution for a smoother experience.

By default, WooCommerce will show all shipping methods that match the customer and the cart contents. This means Free Shipping will also show along with [Flat Rate](https://woocommerce.com/document/flat-rate-shipping/) and other [Shipping Methods](https://woocommerce.com/product-category/woocommerce-extensions/shipping-methods). The functionality to hide all other methods and only show **Free Shipping** requires either custom PHP code or a plugin/extension.

If you’d like to see this feature added to WooCommerce core, visit our [Ideas Board](https://woocommerce.com/forums/133476-woocommerce/suggestions/32436028-hide-specific-shipping-method-if-free-shipping-is) and add your vote to it. The more popular an idea becomes, the more of a priority it is for our developers to review.

Refer to our [Developer Documenation for shipping-related PHP snippets](https://developer.woocommerce.com/docs/code-snippets/free_shipping_customization/#code-snippets) that can help with the following:

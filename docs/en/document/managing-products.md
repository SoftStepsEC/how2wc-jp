Before you can start selling, you need products to offer. That’s why adding and managing your inventory is a crucial step in setting up your shop.

In WooCommerce, you can add a product with just a name and a price. However, the more details you provide, the more appealing your products become to customers—and the better they perform in search results. As you go through this process, you’ll quickly realize there’s a lot to consider.

You’ll need to decide which categories to use for organizing and displaying your products. Will you charge tax? How will you track stock? If you offer shipping, do you need to include product dimensions and weight? How will you handle products with variations, like a shirt that comes in different colors? What attributes will you need for these products? Will you allow reviews, encourage them site-wide, per product, or not at all?

Thinking about these questions ahead of time makes adding and managing products much easier. Use the links below to learn how to add/edit/manage different types of products, navigate the product editor, and sort/filter/feature products in your shop:

Simple Products are the most straightforward type of product in WooCommerce. They consist of a single item without any variations, making them perfect for selling individual items like books or electronics. Adding a Simple Product requires just a few key details like product name, price, and description, making it quick and easy to get started. Of course you can also add product images, attributes, and more to entice shoppers.

Grouped Products allow you to showcase multiple products on a single product page. This is ideal for offering collections or sets, such as a set of furniture or a bundle of related books. Each item within a grouped product can be added to the cart individually, giving customers flexibility while encouraging them to buy more.

External/Affiliate Products let you showcase items that are sold on other websites. Instead of selling the product directly through your store, this product type provides a link to the external product page. This is an excellent option for affiliate marketing or curating a selection of products from different sources.

Variable Products are ideal for items that come in multiple variations, such as different sizes or colors. Each variation can have its own price, SKU, stock level, and other attributes, providing a way to manage complex products. Variable products cover a variety of use cases from fashion items, to electronics with multiple configurations, and more.

“Virtual” and “Downloadable” are designations that can be applied to products in WooCommerce, which change how they’re handled in your shop. Virtual products are intangible items like services or memberships that don’t require shipping. Downloadable products, on the other hand, are digital files such as eBooks, software, or music that customers can access immediately after payment. These options provide flexibility for selling non-physical goods and can be used in combination with other product types to enhance your offerings.

The “edit product” page in WooCommerce is your interface for managing all aspects of your products. From setting prices and stock levels to adding descriptions and images, this page provides a comprehensive interface for fine-tuning your product details. With a variety of settings available, it’s crucial to understand how each one affects your product listings. Our thorough reference guide can help you navigate these options effectively, ensuring your products are presented in the best possible way.

Sometimes a big sale or shipment of new inventory means you’ll need to update many existing products at once. WooCommerce’s bulk editing feature is designed to save you time and effort by allowing you to make changes to multiple products simultaneously. Whether you need to adjust prices, update stock levels, or modify product categories, bulk editing streamlines the process, ensuring your store stays up-to-date without the need for repetitive individual edits.

As your store evolves you may need to delete certain products or duplicate others to quickly add a new product with a similar configuration. WooCommerce provides built-in options for managing this.

WooCommerce has options to help you feature, filter, and sort products. Marking products as featured lets you highlight them to your customers, increasing visibility for special items. Filtering products in the admin view allows you to quickly locate specific items, making management more efficient. Sorting products determines how they are displayed on the front-end, ensuring customers see your products in the order you prefer.

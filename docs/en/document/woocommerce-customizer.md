url: https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-customizer/
---

WooCommerce Customizer is part of **WordPress > Customize** and makes it possible to select options that apply site-wide for Store Notice, Product Catalog, and Product Images without touching any code.

**Note:**

Block themes supporting full site editing and don’t use the customizer. However, when you access the URL directly: `https://example.com/wp-admin/customize.php` the customizer and the WooCommerce customizer settings can be accessed. Additionally, the customizer may still be available on a block theme if another plugin is installed that registers/uses settings on the customizer page.

From the WordPress dashboard, go to: **Appearance > Customize**. Next, in the Customize navigation menu, select **WooCommerce**:

Under **WooCommerce**there are five options to choose from. You can learn more about each of these options by clicking the links below.

- **Store Notice:**Add a store wide alert/banner notice to announce sales, shipping delays, special events, etc. to your customers.
- **Product Catalog:**Configure the appearance of the shop catalog by determining what to show on the shop page and how many products or categories are viewable at one time.
- **Product Page and Product Images:**Set what customers see on the single product page and control how product catalog images and thumbnails display.
- **Checkout:**Configure the display of certain fields on checkout, set the store’s privacy policy and terms of service pages, and choose the messaging shown with the store’s privacy policy.

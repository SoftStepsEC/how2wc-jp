When listing a plugin on the Woo Marketplace, it’s important to understand how we approach monetization. Our goal is to ensure alignment between how your plugin generates value and how that value is captured, creating a transparent experience for merchants and sustainable partnerships for developers.

**Please note:** We do not currently accept free plugins that have no path to monetization. There should be a path to monetization either within the plugin itself or through connection to other paid products or services that then fall into one of the monetization models listed below.

The monetization model for your Marketplace listing should reflect the way your solution generates revenue:

- **Standalone functionality plugins**: Plugins that extend WooCommerce with features not tied to an external system can be sold through the standard Marketplace license model, with billing handled directly through Woo.
- **Integration plugins**: Plugins that connect WooCommerce to an external service or platform require a monetization approach that matches how the integrated system bills merchants.

For plugins that add functionality to WooCommerce without connecting to an external service, we offer two listing options:

**Paid license**

The Marketplace supports a single-site license model. If you sell your plugin elsewhere with multi-site licenses or tiered packages, your Marketplace listing should use a price that closely matches your existing single-site license fee.

**Freemium**

If your plugin offers both free and paid tiers, you can list it using our Freemium model. This allows merchants to install a free version of your plugin with the option to upgrade to a paid tier for additional features. Freemium listings help merchants try before they buy while giving you an opportunity to demonstrate value and drive upgrades.

Freemium is ideal for plugins where:

- An additional plugin is needed to provide the upgraded features
- Core functionality works well as a free offering
- Premium features provide clear, demonstrable value worth upgrading for
- You want to build a user base before converting to paid

For plugins that integrate WooCommerce with an external system, we have specific expectations:

**1. First-party development preferred**

We strongly prefer that integration plugins are built and maintained by the company that owns or operates the external system being integrated. This ensures:

- Merchants have a direct relationship with the company billing them
- Technical support comes from the team with deepest product knowledge
- Long-term maintenance aligns with the external system’s roadmap

In particular, payment extensions must be developed/maintained by Woo or the payment provider directly, and meet minimum quality standards.

If you’re a third-party developer building an integration for a system you don’t operate, we encourage you to connect with that company directly or [contact our Marketplace team](https://woocommerce.com/document/monetization-expectations-for-marketplace-plugins/#contact-us) to discuss your specific situation.

**2. Appropriate billing structure**

Plugins that connect to externally-billed services cannot use the standard paid Marketplace license model. Instead, you must use one of the following options:

**About the Partnership Agreement**

The Partnership Agreement is available as an alternative when the Billing API is not suitable for your business model. However, this option requires formal agreement to our partnership conditions and is subject to approval at our discretion. We assess each application to ensure alignment with Marketplace standards and merchant experience expectations.

If you’re considering this option, we recommend [contacting our Marketplace team](https://woocommerce.com/document/monetization-expectations-for-marketplace-plugins/#contact-us) early in your planning process to discuss eligibility and requirements before investing development effort.

Themes listed on the Woo Marketplace use the standard paid license model only. Billing is handled directly through Woo using a single-site license fee.

If you sell your theme elsewhere with multi-site licenses or tiered packages, your Marketplace listing should use a price that closely matches your existing single-site license fee.

Business services (such as consulting, development, or managed services) require a formal agreement and prior approval from the Marketplace team before listing.

If you offer business services that complement WooCommerce and would like to explore listing on the Marketplace, please [contact the Marketplace team](https://woocommerce.com/document/monetization-expectations-for-marketplace-plugins/#contact-us) to discuss your offering and eligibility requirements.

If you’re unsure which monetization model applies to your plugin, theme, or service, or if you’d like to discuss partnership options before submitting for review, please [contact the Marketplace team](https://woocommerce.com/partnerships-contact/). We recommend reaching out early in your planning process to ensure alignment before you invest significant development effort.

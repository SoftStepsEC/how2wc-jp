When a WooCommerce site uses an [extension or theme](https://woocommerce.com/products) offered in the WooCommerce.com Marketplace, they may be:

- Sharing data with external services (such as a billing address) in order to process a payment.
- Collecting additional personal data (such as city and ZIP code) to calculate shipping rates.

This documentation describes which data from your customers may be collected and shared when you use extensions and themes sold on WooCommerce.com. This resource provides a general overview; if you have specific concerns about a particular product, we encourage you to [contact support](https://woocommerce.com/my-account/contact-support/).

Depending on which settings are enabled and which additional plugins/extensions are used, the specific information shared by your store will vary. We recommend consulting with a lawyer when deciding which information to disclose in your store’s privacy policy.

As a general rule, store owners should minimize how much personal data they collect, store, and share. They should also disclose the information they’re collecting, storing, and sharing in their privacy policy.

**By using an extension or theme from the WooCommerce.com Marketplace, you are generally not sharing information about your customers with WooCommerce.com.**

You will likely be sharing some information about yourself with WooCommerce.com, for example:

- When you make a purchase on WooCommerce.com and connect your account, we will know which sites you are using the subscription on. We will **not** have access to additional usage data, or data about you and your customers.
- If you are using an extension to connect to an external service like Instagram, we may store an authentication token in order to make that connection. We will **not** have access to additional data about your use of that service or extension.

For more information on how WooCommerce.com and our parent company Automattic handle personal data, please [review our privacy policy](https://automattic.com/privacy).

Additionally, if you are using Jetpack or WooCommerce Shipping & Tax (which requires Jetpack), you may be sending data about your customers. [Learn more in Jetpack’s Privacy Center](https://jetpack.com/support/privacy/).

For more on what information is shared with Marketplace developers when you purchase a subscription for their products on WooCommerce.com or log a support request with them, [read our overview](https://woocommerce.com/document/marketplace-developers-customer-overview/#section-3).

If you choose to accept payments via a [gateway](https://woocommerce.com/document/premium-payment-gateway-extensions/#section-1) like Stripe or PayPal, some of your — and your customers’ — data will be passed to the respective third party. This includes information required to process or support the payment, such as the purchase total and your customer’s billing information. [See privacy considerations for payments extensions](https://woocommerce.com/document/privacy-payments/).

To take advantage of real-time shipping rates, fulfill orders, and track shipments, certain shipping-related information about you and your customers — including shopping carts, orders, and the configuration of your site — will be passed to the respective service. [See privacy considerations for shipping providers](https://woocommerce.com/document/privacy-shipping/).

WordPress and WooCommerce do **not** store information from emails by default. Using an extension like Product Enquiry Form, for example, will not store any information on your site.

However, by using these extensions, you may still be storing or sharing personal data with an external service. This may be through another plugin/extension or email client — you will need to make your visitors aware of that.

WooCommerce stores may choose to connect to third-party email services, analytics, reporting tools, accounting software, and other services to serve their customers. By doing so, they may be sharing certain data with those services.

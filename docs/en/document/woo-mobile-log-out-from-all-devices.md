From time to time, you may need to log out of all devices connected to your WooCommerce store — including the WooCommerce Mobile App.

1. In your WordPress.com account, navigate to [Security > Connected Applications](https://wordpress.com/me/security/connected-applications).
2. Click the **Disconnect** button next to an application name to delete the connection between your site and the application.
3. Once successful, you should see the following message displayed: *This application no longer has access to your WordPress.com account.*

You must **log out** of the Woo Mobile App and **log back in** to reconnect your device.

- Change the password.
- In your WP Admin dashboard, navigate to **Users > Edit > Application Passwords** to revoke the [application password](https://woocommerce.com/document/android-ios-apps-login-help-faq/#application-password-disabled) for the user you want to log out.

If you’re using the Jetpack plugin to connect the mobile app to your site, ensure that the Jetpack connection is active and functioning correctly. [Review common issues](https://jetpack.com/support/getting-started-with-jetpack/known-issues/) or [reconnect your site](https://jetpack.com/support/reconnecting-reinstalling-jetpack/).

If you’re still having difficulty, contact support from within the app by going to *Menu > Settings > Help & Support > Contact Support*.

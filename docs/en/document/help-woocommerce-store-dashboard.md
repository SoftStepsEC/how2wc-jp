You can access help from most WooCommerce pages in your store’s WP Admin dashboard via the **Help** tab.

1. In WP Admin, navigate to *WooCommerce > Orders* or any sub-page (except *WooCommerce > Customers* and *Dashboard*).
2. Click the **Help** tab located in the top right corner.

A detailed help screen will appear with three tabs on the left side:

- **Help & Support**: Links to official documentation, the WordPress.org community support forum, and WooCommerce.com support.
- **Found a bug?**: Allows you to report a bug you may have found in WooCommerce. Before submitting a report, verify the issue, detail the steps needed to reproduce the bug, and include screenshots. If you’re unsure, use the **Help & Support** option instead.
- **Setup wizard**: Access the onboarding guide you encountered when installing WooCommerce. You can also choose to enable or disable the task list and extended task list.

The right-hand sidebar contains more options:

- **About WooCommerce:** Learn more about WooCommerce.
- **WordPress.org project**: Visit WooCommerce’s plugin page on WordPress.org.
- **GitHub project**: View or contribute to WooCommerce’s code repository on GitHub.
- **Official themes**: Browse recommended themes in the WooCommerce Marketplace.
- **Official extensions**: Explore the extensions available from the WooCommerce Marketplace.

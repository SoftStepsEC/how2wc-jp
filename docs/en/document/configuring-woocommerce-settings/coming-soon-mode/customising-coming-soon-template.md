The Coming Soon page template in WooCommerce is fully customizable through the [Site Editor](https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-store-editing/the-editor/), allowing you to modify its design to align with your brand. You can adjust colors, fonts, and layout, ensuring that your coming soon page reflects your store’s identity while maintaining an engaging appearance.

### New Coming Soon Designs in WooCommerce 9.8+

WooCommerce 9.8 introduced new Coming Soon designs. Merchants can now choose from beautifully designed designs:

1. **Default Coming Soon** – A full-screen purple design with logo and message.
2. **Image Gallery** – A versatile gallery-style design that allows you to showcase a preview of your products with multiple images. Ideal for merchants who want to give visitors a sneak peek of what’s coming when the store launches. The gallery layout lets you highlight various products or features simultaneously, building anticipation for your full catalog.
3. **Coming Soon With Header and Footer** – Maintains your site’s header and footer while showing the coming soon content.
4. **Minimal Left Image** – A clean, two-column coming soon page with a large, rounded image on the left and a concise launch message on the right. The spacious layout emphasizes simplicity and elegance, perfect for brands seeking a refined, modern pre-launch presence.
5. **Modern Black** – A bold coming soon page with a full-width background image and a centered message overlay for strong visual impact. Minimal yet powerful, it’s ideal for brands wanting a dramatic first impression.
6. **Split Right Image** – A dynamic two-column layout balancing content and visuals. A compact announcement with a small image sits on the left, while a bold, full-height background image with overlaid text dominates the right. Perfect for brands blending storytelling with strong imagery.

2. Click on **Editor** link under the **Coming soon** radio button.

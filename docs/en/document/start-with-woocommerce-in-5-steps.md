In this Getting Started guide, we teach you how to set up a website with WooCommerce.

See [Official WooCommerce Hosting](https://woocommerce.com/hosting-solutions/) page for our recommendations.

If you choose another host instead of WordPress.com you can use the free WordPress software platform. Many hosting companies have one-click WordPress installation available, so be sure to look for this option or ask if it’s available. Otherwise, you can download from [WordPress.org](https://wordpress.org/download/) and then install by following instructions at [How to install WordPress](https://wordpress.org/support/article/how-to-install-wordpress/).

### Activate WooCommerce

With your self-hosted website up and running, it’s time to install ecommerce functionality with **WooCommerce**. There are three ways to do this.

- Create a free account on WooCommerce.com
  - Sign-up for an account on WordPress.com and WooCommerce.com
  - Select from:
    - A pre-installed solution with a trusted host
    - Auto-installing WooCommerce if you have a WordPress site already
    - Download the zip file and do it yourself
    
  
- Install WooCommerce
  - Download the WooCommerce plugin
    - Download the plugin
    - Go to your website
    - Go to: Dashboard > Plugins > Add New > Upload
    - Select the downloaded plugin
    - Install
    - Activate
    
  - Search for the WooCommerce plugin from within your website
    - Go to your website
    - Go to: **Dashboard > Plugins > Add New > Search Plugins**
    - Search for “WooCommerce”
    - Install
    - Activate
    
  

Upon activating the plugin, you are prompted with a [Setup Wizard](https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-setup-wizard/). We strongly advise following these steps, as it takes you through initial setup.

In the **Setup Wizard** mentioned above, you will be asked to pick a theme. The theme you choose will determine the starting look and layout of your store/site (though you can customize it from there!). You can use a free theme included with WordPress or purchase a premium theme.

We recommend **Storefront**and its**child themes** because they are built and optimized for WooCommerce. Storefront is free. If you wish to add functionality, you can purchase **Storefront extensions**.

If Storefront isn’t for you, there are lots of other **themes** that work great with WooCommerce.

Grow your store by adding functionality with **extensions**. We sell extensions for nearly everything: [Subscriptions](https://woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-subscriptions/), [Bookings](https://woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-bookings/), [Memberships](https://woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-memberships/), [payment gateways](https://woocommerce.com/product-category/woocommerce-extensions/payment-gateways), [shipping](https://woocommerce.com/product-category/woocommerce-extensions/shipping-methods), and much more.

You can start a store/website for free and scale up as your customer base and revenue grow. Each extension is purchased on a subscription that gives you access to support and product updates. A subscription is billed annually.

Do you still have questions and need assistance?

This documentation is about the free, [core WooCommerce plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce/), for which support is provided in our [community forums on WordPress.org](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/woocommerce). By searching this forum, you’ll often find that your question has been asked and answered before. If you haven’t created a WordPress.org account to use the forums, [here’s how](https://make.wordpress.org/contribute/join/).

- If you’re looking to **extend** the core functionality shown here, we recommend reviewing available extensions in the [WooCommerce Marketplace](https://woocommerce.com/products/).
- Need ongoing advanced support or a **customization** built for WooCommerce? Hire a [Woo Agency Partner](https://woocommerce.com/customizations/).
- Are you a **developer** building your own WooCommerce integration or extension? Check our [Developer Resources](https://developer.woocommerce.com/).

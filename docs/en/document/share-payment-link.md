Share Payment Link is a new feature added to WooCommerce Mobile (from `WCiOS 8.3` and `WCAndroid 9.6`) to help collect payments from your customers. With this new functionality, you can share a payment link with your customers through social networks, emails, or messages.

You can create a **Payment Link** for any orders awaiting payment. To create a **Payment Link** from the mobile app, you can:

1. Head to the `Orders` tab, and open the order from which you want the **Payment Link**.
2. Press the **Collect Payment** button within the **Payment** section.
3. Select the **Share Payment Link** option.

After creating a **Payment Link**, you’ll automatically see the details page where you can copy and share the link with your customers.

Starting from the app version `13.7` on iOS and Android, you can now generate a QR code your customer can scan to pay for the order.

To create a QR code for an order to accept payment, you can:

1. Open the order from which you want the QR code.
2. Press the **Collect Payment** button within the **Payment** section.
3. Select the **Scan to Pay** option.
4. Show the QR code to your customer to scan and proceed to payment.

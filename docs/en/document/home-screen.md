**WooCommerce Home** is a dashboard where you can see your store performance, get useful tips, insights to grow your business, and quickly access the most important areas where you manage your store.

A panel named **Display**, in the upper-right corner of the home screen, allows you to adjust the home screen layout.

You can use the options from this menu to display the home screen, according to your preference, in either a **Single column** or **Two columns** layout.

A **Help** menu to the right of the **Display** panel contains useful document links.

If you’re a brand-new user, the home screen displays a list of the most essential tasks that you need to complete to get your store up and running. Those tasks guide you through these steps and finish the store setup as quickly and efficiently as possible. Visit our [Setup Wizard documentation](https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-setup-wizard/#section-9) to learn more about each task.

Use the ellipsis button in the upper-right corner to hide the checklist. If you change your mind, re-enable it on **WooCommerce > Settings > Help > Setup wizard > Task List**.

The **Inbox** area is dedicated to information from multiple sources such as the WooCommerce core plugin, WooCommerce.com Subscription management, extensions activity, and store achievements. It also displays insights that help with the day-to-day tasks of managing and optimizing a store.

It also displays contextual messages about extensions available in our [marketplace](https://woocommerce.com/product-category/woocommerce-extensions/) that can be useful for your business. You can opt out from receiving such suggestions by navigating to **WooCommerce > Settings > Advanced > WooCommerce.com > Marketplace suggestions**.

The **Stats overview** area provides a quick look at key performance indicators of your store. Each performance indicator displays a label, the value for the selected date range, and a percentage change from the previous period. At the top of this area you can switch between 3 predefined date ranges: **today**, **week to date**, and **month to date**. There’s also a link to associated charts and tabular data for deeper analysis.

You can toggle the display of the following default performance indicators from the customizations found by clicking the elipses-menu in the top right corner of the section:

- **Total sales —**showing Gross Sales less Returns less Coupons plus Taxes plus Shipping. Links to the Analytics > [Revenue report](https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-analytics/revenue-report/).
- **Net sales —**showing Gross Sales less Returns less Coupons. Also links to the Analytics > [Revenue report](https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-analytics/revenue-report/).
- **Orders —** shows the number of new orders placed for a selected date range. Links to the Analytics > [Orders report](https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-analytics/orders-report/).
- **Products sold —** shows the discrete number of items sold. Also links to the Analytics > [Orders report](https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-analytics/orders-report/).

Clicking **View detailed stats** takes you to the [Analytics Overview dashboard](https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-analytics/) for a complete overview of your store performance.

The Activity panel area is visible to the top right when the Store Setup Checklist is hidden or completed. It includes **Orders**, **Stock**, and **Reviews** panels to help you manage your store. The **Reviews** panel is only visible when there are any reviews that require moderation.

The **Orders** panel displays orders that are considered “actionable.” Orders needing fulfillment are shown by default. Click the order number to go to the respective **Edit order** screen. If you’d like to change what orders are actionable, you can change this via the **Actionable statuses** settings at **Analytics > Settings**.

The **Stock** panel displays products that are low on inventory based on a threshold set under **WooCommerce > Settings > Products > Inventory > Low stock threshold** (the default is 2). Select **Update stock** to update the respective product’s stock immediately.

The **Reviews** panel displays unapproved reviews. You can manage additional review settings at **WooCommerce > Settings > Products > Reviews**.

The **Store Management** area is displayed when the Store Setup Checklist is hidden or done and provides quick access to important areas in your store:

- **Market my store**— access **Marketing > Overview**
- **Add products —** access **Products > Add New**
- **Personalize my store**— access either the site editor or the Customizer, depending on the active theme

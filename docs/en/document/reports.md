**WooCommerce Reports are legacy tools.**

With the release of WooCommerce 4.0 in March 2020, these reports are deprecated and won’t receive further updates. For detailed, accurate sales data (filters, segments, CSV exports, dashboards), use the **new and improved Analytics** section (available in WordPress 5.3+ in **WooCommerce → Analytics**). Learn more in the [WooCommerce Analytics documentation](https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-analytics/).

Reports in WooCommerce give you the ability to see your store’s performance from month to month using graphs and stats. It has four sections: Orders, Customers, Stock, and Taxes.

To view these **legacy** reports, go to **WooCommerce → Reports.** (Not recommended; see Analytics above.)

**Orders** allow you to view gross and net sales volume and totals, as well as top sellers, top freebies, top earners, and product downloads. Subsections include Sales by date, Sales by product, Sales by category, Coupons by date, and Customer downloads.

**Note:**

By default, orders marked Processing, On Hold and Completed are counted as sales.

The Orders tab starts with **Sales by date**. This gives you an idea of the current performance via a sales graph and a few way ways to drill down into data. By year, last month, this month, last 7 days, and a custom date range.

The sales graph itself shows the number of gross sales plotted on a light blue line, the net sales plotted in dark blue, the shipping amount plotted in green, refunds plotted in red, and coupon values redeemed in orange. Hovering over a point will give you the exact figure.

The **Sales by product** report shows sales per day in a given range for a specific product or products. Use the **Product search** to include multiple products or select a product from the **Top sellers**, **Top freebies**, or **Top earners**.

You can select any product from your store to view sales data, and again drill down into sales over the last year, last month, this month, last 7 days, or a custom date range.

To view **sales by category**, start by selecting the categories you want to include, or use the “All” option to automatically include all product categories. Then select “Show” to populate the report.

The **Coupons by date** report shows the total amount discounted and number of coupons used over a period of time. You can also filter data by a specific coupon, view the most popular coupons, and coupons giving the most discounts.

**Customer downloads** have unique IDs, enabling them to be tracked and logged. WooCommerce logs when a file was downloaded, which product the file is linked to, the file name, the order associated with the purchase, and the IP address.

You can also apply multiple filters to the list of customer downloads by hovering over **Product**, **Order**, **User**, or**IP address** and selecting the filter to apply. Remove applied filters by selecting the red x next to the filter name.

The **Customers** tab allows you to view the number of orders between **Customers vs. guests** with options to filter by year, last month, this month, last 7 days, and custom. The Customer List option shows a list of all registered customers in a table. The customer list includes Name (Last, First), Username, Email, Location, (Number of) Orders, Money spent, Last order (Order number and date of order), and Actions.

The **Stock** tab includes reports of products that are **low in stock**, **out of stock**, and **most stocked**. The reports in this section cannot be exported.

The **Taxes** tab includes reports listing **Taxes by code** (state) and **Taxes by date** over the last year, last month, this moth or a custom date range.

Most reports have the option to export the data to a CSV file. Stock reports and the customer list cannot be exported.

- Select Export CSV
- Save or view the file

The **Export CSV** feature is hidden from browsers without support for the Download property.

Your legacy report data can only be reset by deleting prior orders, customers, and other relevant data. However, it’s not recommended. If you decide to delete order data, you’ll need to clear your browser cache to see the reset reports. We recommend using the [new Analytics experience](https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-analytics/), which supports resetting and historical imports.

The only columns and categories available are those shown. If you require a different or additional column, it would require custom code or a plugin to add that feature/functionality.

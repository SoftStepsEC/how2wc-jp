**Note:**

WooCommerce blocks are the simplest, most flexible way to display products on posts and pages. [Learn more about WooCommerce blocks](https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-store-editing/blocks/).

WooCommerce has traditionally utilized shortcodes to add dynamic content and features to WordPress pages. With WordPress’s evolution toward the Gutenberg block-based editor, the focus has shifted from shortcodes to more interactive and visually integrated blocks.

While the block editor offers interactively customizable blocks and enhanced editing capabilities, we recognize many stores still lean heavily on shortcodes. You can use legacy shortcodes inside a [shortcode block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/shortcode-block/).

Shortcodes can be used on WordPress posts and pages. If you are using the block editor, you can **paste the shortcode** into a shortcode block.

If you are using the Classic Editor, you can paste the shortcode directly into the page or post content.

Some shortcodes allow you to modify them to make them more specific or display content in a certain way. You can modify shortcodes by adding **attributes** (AKA arguments or args) to them.

For example, adding the attribute `id` to the `[add_to_cart]` shortcode will create an add-to-cart button for a specific product. `[add_to_cart id=”99”]` displays an add-to-cart button for the product with an ID of `99` in your shop.

The table below provides an overview of the shortcodes available in WooCommerce. Each item includes a brief description and a link to shortcode-specific documentation.

As WooCommerce has moved to [block-based store editing](https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-store-editing/), we’ve also included links to block alternatives for each shortcode (where applicable).

**Note**;

A variety of blocks display products with different options, including the all products block, hand-picked products block, products by category block, products by tag block, and more. These are being deprecated in favor of the more robust and versatile [product collection block](https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-store-editing/customizing-shop-page-catalog/product-collection-block/).

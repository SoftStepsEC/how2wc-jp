We are beginning to translate WooCommerce-owned extensions into multiple languages, starting with Spanish. Supported languages are highlighted on each product page, with country flags helping to identify whether the extension is supported in that location.

We will not force vendors to provide translations of their extensions. If a vendor would like to provide translations of their extensions, they can do so by submitting that extension in the host language.

WooCommerce plans to translate our extensions into Spanish, French, and Portuguese. We have no plans to expand beyond these languages at this time.

We will begin with [WooCommerce Bookings](https://woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-bookings/), including its companion extensions [WooCommerce Bookings Availability](https://woocommerce.com/products/bookings-availability/) and [WooCommerce Accommodation Bookings.](https://woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-accommodation-bookings/)

We will not require third-party extensions to be translated. Developers can submit their extensions in multiple languages but that does not guarantee support in that language. Please check the support guidelines of each vendor.

WooCommerce is localization-ready out of the box. Review our [in-depth translation directions](https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-localization/#section-2).

WooCommerce and WordPress thrive on contributions from our user base — all that’s needed is a translation file for your language. [Submit your translation](https://translate.wordpress.org/).

If you’re new to translating, get started by reviewing the [Translate WordPress handbook](https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/handbook/tools/glotpress-translate-wordpress-org/).

Do you still have questions and need assistance?

This documentation is about the free, [core WooCommerce plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce/), for which support is provided in our [community forums on WordPress.org](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/woocommerce).

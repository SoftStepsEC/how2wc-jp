WooPayments uses a pay-as-you-go pricing model. In other words, there are no setup fees, monthly fees, or other hidden charges. Instead, our fees are deducted directly from each payment made via WooPayments.

The exact fees we charge differ based on various factors, such as:

- The country your business is located in.
- The country your customer is located in.
- The currency in which the customer paid.
- The specific payment method used to pay.

Please familiarize yourself with the terms used on this page so that you can accurately assess the fees you will be charged for any given transaction.

- **Base Fee:** The fee that applies to every transaction using a given payment method. In other words, this is the smallest amount that you can possibly be charged. It usually has a variable portion (a percentage) and a fixed portion (a flat fee).
- **International Payment:** An added percentage fee applied if the customer’s payment method originates from outside your WooPayments account country.
- **Currency Conversion:** An added percentage fee applied if the customer’s payment currency does not match the currency of [any bank account](https://woocommerce.com/document/woopayments/payouts/payout-currencies/) you use for payouts.
- **Dispute:** A flat fee charged for each [dispute](https://woocommerce.com/document/woopayments/fraud-and-disputes/) filed by a customer. This fee is refunded to you automatically should you challenge and win the dispute.
- **N/A:** “Not applicable”, meaning there are no additional fees in that particular scenario, or that the scenario cannot even occur (e.g. currency conversion for BNPL methods).

Finally, note that this document uses `.` as the [decimal separator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal_separator) and `,` as the [digit grouper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal_separator#Digit_grouping), even when showing fees for countries where other rules are customary.

The following items apply to all merchants, regardless of country:

- Transaction fees are [not refunded](https://woocommerce.com/document/woopayments/fees-and-debits/why-arent-fees-refunded/) to you when you issue refunds to customers.
- Fees for Apple Pay, Google Pay, Link, and WooPay are the same as for cards.
- The currency in which fees are charged [may vary](https://woocommerce.com/document/woopayments/fees-and-debits/fee-currency/) if you enable multi-currency.
- VAT, GST, or Consumption Tax may apply to the WooPayments fees and are noted for each applicable country below. If your business is registered for VAT or GST, then you may qualify for a zero rate. Being exempt from registering for VAT or GST does not exempt you from taxes on your WooPayments fees.
- Your account balance may [become negative](https://woocommerce.com/document/woopayments/fees-and-debits/account-showing-negative-balance/) for various reasons. If it does, that might cause WooPayments to [debit your bank account](https://woocommerce.com/document/woopayments/fees-and-debits/why-was-i-debited/). These debits, if they occur, are not a type of fee. Please see the above links for more information.

For some countries, the International Payment fee is based on whether the customer used a European card or a non-European card. As a reference, WooPayments considers “European cards” to be those issued in any of the following countries:

- Andorra
- Austria
- Belgium
- Bulgaria
- Croatia
- Cyprus
- Czech Republic
- Denmark
- Estonia
- Faroe Islands
- Finland
- France
- Germany
- Gibraltar
- Greece

- Greenland
- Guernsey
- Hungary
- Iceland
- Ireland
- Isle of Man
- Israel
- Italy
- Jersey
- Latvia
- Liechtenstein
- Lithuania
- Luxembourg
- Malta

- Monaco
- Netherlands
- Norway
- Poland
- Portugal
- Romania
- St. Pierre and Miquelon
- San Marino
- Slovakia
- Slovenia
- Spain
- Sweden
- Türkiye
- Vatican City

For example, if an Austrian merchant takes a payment from a Lithuanian card, the merchant would **not** be charged the International Payment fee for that order.

WooPayments does not have an easy way to add the amount of the transaction fees to the order total, thus making your customers more or less “subsidize” your fees.

You may be able to use the [Payment Gateway Based Fees](https://woocommerce.com/document/payment-gateway-based-fees/) extension (or a similar plugin) to approximate this, but there are some important things to keep in mind:

- We haven’t tested this solution ourselves, and cannot guarantee that it will work.
- There may be legal implications to doing this, depending on your country.

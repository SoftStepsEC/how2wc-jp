**Note:** The customizer is hidden If you are using a block theme that supports Full Site Editing. However, when you access the URL directly: `https://example.com/wp-admin/customize.php` the customizer and the WooCommerce customizer settings will load. Additionally, the customizer may still be available on a block theme if another plugin is installed that registers/uses settings on the the customizer page.

The **Store Notice** menu in the WooCommerce customizer allows you to enter a site-wide message shown to everyone visiting your store. The message can be:

- **Informational** – For example, a note that tells customers of shipping delays due to weather conditions. An ‘away’ notice if on vacation.
- **Promotional** – For example, a note advertising an event, a holiday special, a bundle, a sale on all/some items or free shipping.

On this page you’ll learn how to:

- Create a store notice.
- Schedule a store notice.
- Edit or Remove a store notice.

### Adding a Store Notice

To add and display a store notice to your customers, follow these steps:

1. Go to: **Appearance > Customize > WooCommerce > Store Notice**:

1. **Enter** a **message** in the text area.

1. Tick the box for **Enable Store Notice**.

1. **Preview** how the Store Notice looks on your site/store.

1. **Publish** when satisfied and ready for your Store Notice to go live.

### Schedule a Store Notice

Using the **Schedule** option for **Store Notice** can be helpful when running a promotion for a limited time or ending a sale/discount at midnight on a specific date.

In this example, we want to discontinue the Free Shipping offer when it expires end of day on February 28.

1. Go to **Appearance > Customize > WooCommerce > Store Notice** to view and access the current/published promotion.

1. **Untick box** for **Enable Store Notice**.

1. **Select** the **gear wheel**. A panel opens.
2. Select **Schedule** on the right menu, then **enter the Date and Time** you want the change to take effect.

1. Select **Schedule** to make changes you entered on the **future Date and Time** indicated.

### What Customers See

This is how the Store Notice displays on the front end of your store/site. Visitors can choose to **Dismiss** the notice after seeing it once.

*Location and appearance of the Store Notice will vary, depending on the theme you’re using. The screenshot above is with our free [Storefront theme](https://woocommerce.com/storefront/).

### Edit or Remove a Store Notice

To change or stop displaying a site-wide Store Notice:

1. Go to: **Appearance > Customize > WooCommerce > Store Notice**:

1. Edit the Store Notice:
  - **Edit**the **message** in the Store Notice text area to change it.
  

- **Untick the box** for **Enable Store Notice** to stop displaying to visitors.

1. **Publish** to save changes.

**Note:** You need to disable sale discounts, coupon codes, or limited-time offers. Removing the notice does not automatically stop the promotion from running it only removes the notice about them from your store.

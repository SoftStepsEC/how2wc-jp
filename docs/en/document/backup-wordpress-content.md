title: Backing up WordPress content

Each store powered by WooCommerce and WordPress has **two places** where its data and content are stored:

1. The `wp-content` folder, where themes, plugins, and uploaded content are located.
2. The database, where products, orders, posts, pages, etc. are organized and stored.

So, how should you safeguard your content and keep it backed up?

The most efficient and reliable approach is to use an [automated backup service](https://jetpack.com/pricing/woocommerce-backup/); we recommend [Jetpack VaultPress Backup](https://jetpack.com/pricing/woocommerce-backup/).

By using Jetpack Vaultpress Backup, you’ll benefit from:

- Automated, regular backups of **your entire site** — including database, content, media, plugins, themes, and settings.
- Features tailored for WooCommerce:
  - Restore your site to any past state while keeping all orders and products current.
  - Protect your customer data and stay GDPR-compliant.
  - Custom WooCommerce table backups.
  
- A complete list of all site activity and recorded changes.
- Instant restores; if something goes wrong, you can quickly revert to a previous version with one click.
- Direct access to 24/7 expert support.

There are two steps to backing up your site content manually.

1. In your store’s WP Admin dashboard, go to **Tools > Export** to export all of your **site content** (posts, pages, comments, etc.) in an XML file.
2. To back up your **theme and extension/plugin files**, log into your site via File Transfer Protocol (FTP) to find your files in the `wp-content` **folder**. If you made any customizations to your theme, we **strongly recommend** making a backup of your theme files.

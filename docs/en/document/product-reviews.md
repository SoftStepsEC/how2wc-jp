**Product reviews** are a powerful tool for online conversions and establishing loyal relationships with your customers. WooCommerce allows customers to create reviews with star ratings and for the shop owner to moderate and reply to customer reviews.

Studies show that a product review, or a recommendation from another shopper, has a large effect on a customer’s decision to purchase a product. From this document, you’ll learn:

- How to enable product reviews.
- How to view and manage product reviews.
- How to moderate product reviews.

Enable reviews for WooCommerce by following these steps:

1. From the WordPress Dashboard go to **WooCommerce > Settings**.
2. Switch to the **Products** tab.
3. Scroll down to the **Reviews** section and select the **Enable product reviews** check box.
4. You can also select the options related to reviews and ratings:
  1. **Show “verified owner” label on customer reviews**— whether to label reviews from verified customers. A verified customer is a one that has purchased the product from your store.
  2. **Reviews can only be left by “verified owners” —** allow reviews from only verified customers.
  3. **Enable star rating on reviews —**enables the star rating review option for reviews.
  4. **Star ratings should be required, not optional —** make star rating mandatory for reviews.
  
5. Press **Save changes** to apply the settings.

Once the reviews have been enabled, you then have an option to enable or disable reviews per product in the **Advanced section** of the **Product Data** settings:

With product reviews active, the review form will be displayed at the storefront and your customers will be able to add their review and star rating, if enabled.

When a new review is posted, it shows on the dashboard at **WooCommerce > Home** and under **Products > Reviews**.

From **WooCommerce > Home** you can:

- Expand the **Reviews** section to view the details and moderation options.
- Select either **Approve**, **Mark as spam**, or **Delete**.
- Once one of the moderation actions has been applied to the review, it is removed from the section.
- Selecting **Manage All Reviews** takes you directly to the**Products > Reviews** page.

On the **Products > Reviews** page, hovering over a review reveals actions in the **Review** column that can apply to the review:

- **Approve —** approve reviews that are not yet approved.
- **Unapprove —**unapprove reviews that have been approved.
- **Reply**— reveals a field from where to reply to user reviews.
- **Quick Edit**— turns the review into an edit box to quickly make changes to the **Review**, **Name**, **Email**, and **URL**.
- **Edit**— make changes to the same options as **Quick Edit**, with the addition of a full-text editor and the ability to change the star rating.
- **Spam**— moves the spam review to the **Spam** subtab.
- **Trash**— moves the review to the **Trash** subtab.

The **Bulk actions** drop-down allows you to quickly apply bulk actions to your reviews, including **Approve**, **Unapprove**, **Mark as spam,** and **Move to Trash**.

To simplify managing your reviews, they can be filtered by **Type** (Review or Reply), **Rating**, and/or **Product. Reviews** can also be sorted by the **Author**, **Product**, **Submitted on**, **Type,** and **Ratings** columns. Columns can be hidden or revealed via the **Screen Options** tab found to the top-right of the screen.

Replies to comments from the store owner are batched within the initial review to make it easier to locate and reply to any threads on a review.

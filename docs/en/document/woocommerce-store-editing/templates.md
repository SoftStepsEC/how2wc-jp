Templates are arrangements of blocks that determine the appearance and layout of multiple posts, pages, and products. You can create **custom templates** or use the **templates provided** by your theme or a plugin. When you make changes to a template, the editor updates the blocks on all pages/posts that use the template.

[Learn more about the Template Editor](https://wordpress.org/support/article/template-editor/).

WooCommerce includes a selection of templates that control your store’s appearance.

To view all available WooCommerce templates:

1. From your WP Admin dashboard, navigate to **Appearance > Editor**.
2. Click **Templates**.
3. At the bottom of the left sidebar menu, click **Manage All Templates**.
4. In the left sidebar, click **WooCommerce**.

Alternatively, you can access any template directly via the [Editor Command Palette](https://wordpress.com/support/site-editor/command-palette/):

1. From your WP Admin dashboard, navigate to **Appearance > Editor**.
2. On your keyboard, press Cmd+K (MacOS) or Ctrl+K (Windows).
3. Alternatively, if you’re already editing a template or template part, you can **click the template title** to search for commands:

WooCommerce includes a collection of customizable templates out of the box:

- Single Product
- Product Catalog
- Product Search Results
- Products by Attribute
- Products by Category
- Products by Tag
- Order Confirmation
- Page: Cart
- Page: Checkout

These templates are **customizable**. You can move blocks around and add further blocks around them to extend and customize the template. You can also create custom templates for specific individual products, or specific categories of products.

If your theme includes any of the above templates, they will **automatically override** WooCommerce’s default ones.

**Developers:** If you’d like to override the default WooCommerce block templates in your custom block theme, please place your customized versions of these templates within your theme’s `/templates` directory. [Review the WooCommerce block template files in GitHub](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/tree/trunk/plugins/woocommerce/templates/templates/blockified). [Learn more about templates](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/templates/templates/#how-do-templates-work).

In some cases, the easiest way to move forward with customizing a template is to clear all your previous changes and reset the template back to its default state. There are several ways to achieve this.

To clear your template customizations:

1. From your WP Admin dashboard, navigate to **Appearance > Editor**.
2. Click **Templates**.
3. At the bottom of the left sidebar menu, click **Manage All Templates**.
4. Templates that have been customized will display an icon of a **clock** with a counterclockwise arrow around it, labeled **Reset** (see image below).
5. Click this icon to clear customizations for that template.

Alternatively, you can also:

1. Open the Editor via **Appearance > Editor**.
2. Click **Templates**.
3. Select/open the template containing the customizations you wish to clear.
4. Click the three-dot **kebab menu icon** (⁝) next to the template name.
5. Click **Clear customizations**.

Clearing the customizations you’ve made to a template returns the template to its **default state**.

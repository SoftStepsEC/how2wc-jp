WooCommerce.com Marketplace suggestions settings in the core WooCommerce plugin give store owners the flexibility to customize their experience by managing the types of recommendations and suggestions they receive.

This document provides an overview of the settings available, how they work, and best practices for customization — including a filter to disable suggestions programmatically.

Marketplace suggestions are designed to assist store owners by providing personalized recommendations for extensions, services, and features that can enhance their store.

To ensure relevance and value, these suggestions are based on the store’s current setup, installed plugins/extensions, and usage patterns.

Activating this setting allows WooCommerce.com to recommend personalized extension recommendations in relevant areas of your store’s WP Admin dashboard.

These suggestions are designed to help you discover tools and features that can help drive growth and increase your store’s efficiency.

To access and configure your Marketplace suggestions settings:

1. In your store’s WP Admin dashboard, navigate to *WooCommerce > Settings* and click the **Advanced** tab.
2. Next, click the **WooCommerce.com** link in the sub-menu below the tabbed navigation.
3. Under Marketplace suggestions , you will find the Show Suggestions checkbox:
  - If checked, WooCommerce can display personalized suggestions within your store’s WP Admin dashboard.
  - If unchecked, suggestions from WooCommerce.com will not be personalized. Instead, a static list of extensions will be displayed.
  
4. After making your selection, click the **Save changes** button.

It is possible to disable Marketplace suggestions programmatically using a filter. [Refer to our developer documenation](https://developer.woocommerce.com/docs/disabling-marketplace-suggestions-programmatically/) for instructions.

- **Tailor your experience:** Customize your settings to ensure you’re receiving the most relevant recommendations for your store.

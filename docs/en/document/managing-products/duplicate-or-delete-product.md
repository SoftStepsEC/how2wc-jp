As your business evolves, you may find it necessary to delete certain products and duplicate others to quickly add more with similar settings. On this page, you’ll learn how to duplicate products or delete them entirely from your WooCommerce store.

Duplicating existing products can be a huge time-saver. You can use an existing product as a template or base to create similar products with variations or other qualities.

To duplicate an existing product:

1. In your store’s WP Admin dashboard, go to **WooCommerce > Products** and find the product you wish to replicate.
2. Hover your mouse cursor over this product’s row in the product table. You’ll see several options appear — Edit, Quick Edit, Trash, View, and Duplicate (see image below).
3. Click **Duplicate** from this list of options.

Follow these instructions to **delete** a product:

1. In your store’s WP Admin dashboard, go to**WooCommerce > Products** and find the product you wish to delete.
2. Hover your mouse cursor in the area under the product name. You’ll see several options appear — Edit, Quick Edit, Trash, View, and Duplicate (see image below).
3. Click**Trash** from this list of options.

Products in the trash can either be restored or permanently deleted.

1. In your store’s WP Admin dashboard, go to the product table at **WooCommerce > Products.**
2. Click the **Trash** sub-tab link at the top of this table to see all your trashed products.
3. From here you can choose to:
  - **Restore** trashed products individually or several at a time via the Bulk actions dropdown.
  - **Permanently delete**trashed products individually or several at a time via the Bulk actions dropdown.
  - **Empty trash**by clicking the **Empty Trash** button to permanently delete all trashed products.

A WordPress.com account acts like a passport for your WooCommerce store, connecting it to powerful services from WordPress.com and Automattic. These include:

- **WooPayments**: Accept various payment methods securely and seamlessly.
- **WooCommerce Shipping**: Access discounted shipping rates and streamlined label management.
- **Jetpack**: Enhance security, monitor site performance, access valuable insights, and receive push notifications for new orders.

If you don’t already have a WordPress.com account, use the connection screen to create a new account. Enter your email address and click the **Continue with email** button, or continue with one of the single sign-on (SSO) provider buttons: **Continue with Google**, **Continue with Apple**, or **Continue with GitHub**.

To confirm your WordPress.com account, email address:

1. Log into the email account you used to sign up for WordPress.com.
2. Open the email titled “One more step: confirm your email address to get started” (from “WordPress.com” donotreply@wordpress.com).
3. Click the **Confirm my email address** button in the body of the email.

A confirmation email is sent to the email address you signed up with. If it doesn’t appear in your inbox, check your spam or junk mail folders.

To resend the confirmation email or change the email address it’s sent to:

1. Visit your WordPress.com dashboard.
2. Access your profile at [https://wordpress.com/me](https://wordpress.com/me).
3. Look for the notice titled **Please confirm your email address**.
4. Click either **Re-send your confirmation email** or **change the email address on your account**.
5. Check your email inbox, spam, or junk mail folders for the confirmation email.

In the Woo Mobile app, when you log in using your [WordPress.com account](https://woocommerce.com/document/android-ios-apps-login-help-faq/#section-5) (Jetpack Sites) you can access all stores connected to that specific account. This can be very handy for users managing multiple stores since you can easily switch between stores from the app without having to log out and log into a different store.

That said, for Agencies and Shop Managers working with a large number of stores connected to the same account this can become cumbersome.

Starting on version 21.4 of the Woo Mobile apps users connecting to the app via Jetpack/ WordPress.com have the option to hide the sites they don’t use often from the site list. This will also disable push notifications for new orders and product reviews for each site you choose to hide.

If you’re using the Jetpack plugin to connect the app to your site, make sure that the Jetpack connection is active and working correctly. You can verify some[known issues](https://jetpack.com/support/getting-started-with-jetpack/known-issues/)or try[reconnecting your site](https://jetpack.com/support/reconnecting-reinstalling-jetpack/).

If you’re still having difficulty, please fill out our contact form to reach our support team from within the app by going to Menu > Settings > Help & Support > Contact Support.

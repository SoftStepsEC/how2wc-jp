Follow these steps to create an order:

1. Tap on the **+** icon at the top right on the Orders tab.
2. The **New Order** screen will appear.

- Tap on the **+ Add Products**button in the **Products** Section.
- Search for & select the products you wish to add.

- Expand the product card to adjust the quantity using the **quantity stepper or text box** as needed.

Barcode scanning is available on **Android** with application version `13.8` and later and on iOS with version `14.1` or later. This feature allows you to quickly scan product barcodes with your device’s camera to add them to an order. Note that the feature only supports barcode numbers matching your store’s product SKUs.

**Note:** The Mobile App barcode scanner currently only works with codes added to the **SKU** field in the inventory tab. The new **GTIN, UPC, EAN or ISBN** field in WooCommerce core is not yet integrated with the Mobile App.

To get started, tap the **barcode** icon at the top of the Orders tab and scan the barcode of a product to add it to a new order.

Alternatively, from the New Order screen, you can tap on the **barcode** icon next to **+ Add Product** to scan an item and add it to the order.

- Tap on the product you wish to remove to expand the card.

- After the order is created, you will be redirected to the order details screen where you can take the necessary actions to [fulfill the order](https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-ios/#orders).

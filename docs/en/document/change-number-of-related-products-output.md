**Scope of support:**

We are unable to provide support for customizations under our**Support Policy**. If you need to customize a snippet or extend its functionality, we recommend working with a [Woo Agency Partner](https://woocommerce.com/development-services/) or a WooCommerce developer on [Codeable](https://www.codeable.io/partners/woocommerce/?ref=qGefA6#tiers).

Add code to your child theme’s `functions.php` file or via a plugin that allows custom functions to be added, such as the [Code snippets](https://wordpress.org/plugins/code-snippets/) plugin. Avoid adding custom code directly to your parent theme’s `functions.php` file as this will be wiped entirely when you update the theme.

Please note that it does not work for all themes because of the way they’re coded.

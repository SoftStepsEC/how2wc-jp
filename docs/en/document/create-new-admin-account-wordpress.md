To provide the quickest support in trickier cases our Happiness Engineers may request an Administrator account on your site to take a closer look at the issue. If that scenario arises, we’ll request that you create a temporary admin login for us, which should be **deleted** once we are finished.

**Note:**

Please note that to comply with GDPR rules, you need to disclose the sharing of access rights to third parties like Woo in your Terms & Conditions. There is more information about [your responsibilities as a store owner under GDPR](https://woocommerce.com/posts/the-gdpr-and-you-the-woocommerce-store-owner/) on our blog.

1. In your WordPress Admin Dashboard, go to **Users > Add New**.
2. In the **Username (required)**field use `woologin`.
3. In the Email (required) field use woologin@woocommerce.com
  - Happiness Engineers can access this email address if we need to reset the password.
  
4. Copy the **password** generated by WordPress, and send it to us using [QuickForget.com](http://quickforget.com/).
5. Ensure the **Role** is set to `Administrator.`
6. If your site is not in **English**, please set `English` as this user’s language.
7. Select **Add New User**.

Once this admin user is created, here is how to securely send us those details. Visit [QuickForget.com](https://quickforget.com/) and in the “**The secret is…**” field include the following:

- Login URL for your website
- The password you’d created for our user

Once we’ve helped fix and solve any issues, and we no longer need the account, please do delete it from your site. To do so head to **Users > All Users**, then hover over the the woologin account and select **delete**.

Again, for security reasons, we recommend doing this as soon as the interaction us in Woo Happiness support is finished.

[Here’s what the founder of WordPress has to say](http://ma.tt/2013/04/passwords-and-brute-force/) about why you should **never** use `admin` as your username.

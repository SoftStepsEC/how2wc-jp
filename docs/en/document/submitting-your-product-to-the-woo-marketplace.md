We look forward to reviewing your extension, theme, or integration for listing in the WooCommerce.com Marketplace. Before getting started, make sure you have [signed up for a vendor account](https://woocommerce.com/partners/), and are logged into your [vendor dashboard](https://woocommerce.com/wp-admin/).

From your vendor dashboard, navigate to *Submissions > Submit Product* and select the product type you’re planning to submit:

- Extension
- Theme
- SaaS
- Business Service

Freemium products — products with both free and paid versions — require **two separate submissions**, one for each model. These will later be merged into a single product page where users can choose between versions.

The information reuired varies slightly depending on the submission flow selected. To help streamline the submission process, we only ask for critical details:

- Product upload
- Business details
- Testing instructions

Next, **address any submission test failures** noted in the discussion dialog. In the event of failures — marked as *Failed* — please click the **View** link beside the failed test to review the results and upload a modified version of your submission.

If necessary, **replace the previously uploaded file to test again.** When tests fail, the submission status updates to **Changes required**.

To proceed, click the **Replace** button to replace the current .zip file with a corrected version. This will automatically restart the testing process.

If your product is at a stage other than **Changes required**, you will not be able to replace this file. Please [comment within the submission](https://woocommerce.com/document/submitting-your-product-to-the-woo-marketplace/#section-9) to request a status change from the Marketplace team.

Once the submitted product passes automated code tests, it moves to our review queue. Once it has been reviewed, the reviewer will share feedback (if any) with you.

A review consists of the following steps:

1. **Business review**: to ensure your product is a good fit for the Marketplace, and that there is a business model to share revenue.
2. **Code review**: to ensure the submitted product’s code is original, secure, and aligned with overall WordPress and WooCommerce quality standards.
3. **User experience (UX) review**: to ensure the product works as expected and it’s look and feel aligns with our UX guidelines.
4. **Launch preparations**: once a submission successfully passes these review phases, it will be formally approved and proceed to onboarding for launch.

For additional questions related to your submission, please use the discussion box below the **Submission Bot** results table in the **Submission progress** tab.

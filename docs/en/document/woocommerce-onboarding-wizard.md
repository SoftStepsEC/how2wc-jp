Having a customizable ecommerce platform means that there are a lot of available settings to consider and adjust to fit your vision. The Onboarding Wizard and Setup Checklist take you through all the necessary initial steps to set up your store and get it ready to start selling!

Right after activating WooCommerce, you are taken to our Onboarding Wizard. The steps here will let you fill in the most important details about your store. Details like where your store is based, what industry you are in, what type of products you sell, etc…

Once you’ve gone through the onboarding wizard, you’ll see a follow-up checklist that helps make sure all aspects of your store are ready to start bringing in customers and taking orders.

It’s wonderful to have you! We’re excited to help guide you through the setup process, which will help customize your experience and ensure that it aligns perfectly with your needs and preferences.

Click on “Set up my Store” to go to the next step.

Let us know where you are in your commerce journey so we can tailor your experience. Are you just starting out in your commerce journey, selling online, selling offline, or both? Or you are setting up a store for your client?

In this step, please let us know where you stand in your commerce journey so that we can personalize your experience accordingly.

In this step, please provide some information about your store. This information will be utilized to assist in setting up payments, shipping, and taxes for your store.

If the store location you specified does not match your current geolocation, a warning message may appear. This warning is designed to ensure accuracy and alignment between the store’s physical location and the setup process.

However, if you’re currently located elsewhere or setting up a store for a client in a different location, you can safely ignore this warning and proceed by clicking “Continue” to complete the setup.

In this step, you can provide your email address and opt-in to receive tips, discounts, and recommendations from the Woo team.

Based on the information you provided in the previous steps, we will now recommend free business features that can be beneficial for your store. These features are designed to enhance your commerce journey, and the best part is that there is no commitment required.

You have the flexibility to remove any of these features at any time throughout your journey, ensuring that you have complete control over your store’s setup and customization.

In this step, please connect your WordPress.com account so you can take advantage of the benefits offered by [Jetpack](https://jetpack.com/). This connection can also power WooPayments and our WooCommerce Shipping, and Taxes plugins if you are using those plugins.

Once you completed the above steps, we will start rolling out your site with features. So sit back and relax and enjoy some fun facts about WooCommerce!

If you skip the initial setup steps, please enter the location to set up your store.

Once you’ve finished the onboarding, you’ll see a list of 5 steps left to do before launching your store. These are here to make sure you can easily create products, accept payments, collect sales tax and more. Let’s go through each step below.

Selecting Customize your store, you’ll see a screen where you can select an existing theme or create your design by selecting **Start designing.** Once you select **Start designing**, two things may happen;

- If your active theme is already Twenty Twenty-four, selecting **Start designing** will lead you directly to the new Pattern Assembler.
- If you’re on another theme, a prompt will guide you to switch to Twenty Twenty-Four and then on to the Pattern Assembler.

Once you’re in, you can first take a tour of the customization process and let it lead you through its features.

#### Add your logo

Add, delete, or replace your site’s logo to ensure it resonates with your brand.

#### Choose your color palette

Use one of the 18 predefined color pairings, or create your own to customize your site your way.

#### Choose fonts

Explore one of the 8 font pairings. This is powered by the **WordPress Font Library**.

#### Layout

In the Layout section, you can start by choosing a header pattern you’d like for your site. We include four ready-made header patterns. These include common elements like site logo, site title, customer account, and mini-cart blocks alongside a navigation menu.

Next, you can design your homepage and select a pattern that will best showcase your store and products. These blocks and patterns are easily edited to replaced with your own images and link to your own products once ready.

Finally, you are able to pick from 3 footer patterns for your site. These often help include additional links, social icons, etc… Again, the footer is easily edited and further customized if needed.

Once you’ve made all your choices, you can select **Save** to publish your customizations. We’d love to hear from you, so select the Share feedback button to do so. Otherwise, view your store, add products, and continue to fine tune your design.

After you finish or skip the Store Profiler stage you’ll have access to a list of the most important tasks that you need to complete to get your store up and running: products, payments, shipping, taxes, marketing and store personalization. You can skip the checklist whenever you want.

In this step, we’ll guide you through the process of adding your first products using WooCommerce manually:

- **Add manually.** See the documentation on [Adding and Managing Products](https://woocommerce.com/document/managing-products/) in order to know what to expect during the steps of creating a product.
- **Start with a template.** You can choose to start with a pre-filled template of different product types: physical, digital, and variable products.
- **Import.** See the documentation on the built-in [Product CSV Importer and Exporter](https://woocommerce.com/document/product-csv-importer-exporter/) in order to know what to expect when importing products. You can use this [sample CSV file](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/tree/master/sample-data) for products import testing.
- **Migrate.** See the documentation about the [Cart2Cart](https://woocommerce.com/products/cart2cart/) extension to know more about using a product migration service.
- **Import Sample Data.** Not ready to commit to a product, but want to test out the store? Add in sample data to see what a store full of products might look like. See the documentation on the [Importing WooCommerce Sample Data](https://woocommerce.com/document/importing-woocommerce-sample-data/) for instructions.

In this step, you can select and activate one or more options to accept online payments and offline payments. All payments extensions are free, and we automatically install and activate them upon selection.

In some payment gateways, such as [WooPayments](https://woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-payments/), Stripe, and PayPal, we help you create an account in the payment provider, go through the authentication flow and complete the process within this step, so you can start accepting payments right away.

There are a few possible scenarios, depending on where your store is located and the information you provided during the store profiler.

WooPayments is currently available in 15+ countries. You can see the availability [here](https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/countries/#section-1).

If your store is in another country than the United States, you’ll be shown other payment options, like Stripe and PayPal, at your disposal. We also show other options, depending on your store country, such as: Square, Klarna, Mollie, PayFast, PayU, Razorpay, Mercado Pago, PayFast and Eway.

Through the Payments task, you can also easily set up offline payments, such as Cash on Delivery and Direct Bank Transfer.

You have three options available in this step: use [WooCommerce Tax](https://woocommerce.com/products/tax/), use [Avalara](https://woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-avatax/), [set up taxes manually](https://woocommerce.com/document/setting-up-taxes-in-woocommerce/) or not charging sales tax.

You can confirm your store location or add it if you haven’t done it before.

If you selected WooCommerce Tax and have Jetpack installed, you can start automatically calculating taxes by connecting your store to WordPress.com. Visit our [WooCommerce Tax](https://woocommerce.com/products/tax/) page if you want to learn more about automated taxes and the countries where it’s available.

If you select to connect your store, you’ll be redirected to the WordPress.com flow, so you can create an account or login to an existing account.

After you finish that process, you’ll be redirected to the tax task, where you can enable the automated taxes calculation by selecting “Yes please.”

If you choose to set up tax rates manually, you will be redirected to the WooCommerce Settings. See the documentation on [setting up taxes in WooCommerce](https://woocommerce.com/document/setting-up-taxes-in-woocommerce/) to learn more about how to set them up manually.

If at any point, you’d like to return to the onboarding wizard or the setup checklist. For example, if you dismissed the Setup Checklist by accident. You can find them again via the following steps:

1. Navigating to a WooCommerce page that still shows the contextual **Help** tab. For example, the **WooCommerce > Settings** page or **WooCommerce > Status** pages would work.
2. Select the **Help** menu to toggle it open.
3. In that Help menu, select **Setup wizard** in the options on the left.
4. Selecting said button to re-enter the **Setup Wizard** or **Enable** either the **Task list** or the **Extended task list**.
5. After selecting one of the buttons, you’ll be taken to the relevant task list or to the beginning of the guided setup of the Onboarding Wizard.

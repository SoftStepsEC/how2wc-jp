Activating WooCommerce adds 4 main menu items to the WordPress admin dashboard. These are the **WooCommerce**, **Products**, **Analytics**, and **Marketing** menu items.

The main top-level WooCommerce menu item is the gateway to the most-used functions of your store. It includes a dashboard overview in Home, links to orders and customers, settings, store status, and extensions purchased from WooCommerce.com.

**Home** takes you to the Home screen, also known as the WooCommerce dashboard. From there you can stay on top of your store performance, get useful tips and insights to grow your business, and quickly access the most important areas for store management. Follow the button below to read more about the home screen in WooCommerce.

The Orders screen is for viewing and managing existing orders, or manually adding new orders. Select the button below to learn more about managing orders.

The Customers section offers a Customer Report. It’s a list that can be searched and filtered according to requirements to view relevant customer data.

The Reports section offers legacy reports with insights into orders, customers, stocks and taxes. [WooCommerce Analytics](https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-analytics/) is a more powerful and modern alternative that currently coexists with these reports until the former are depricated.

The Settings screen is where the bulk of high-level WooCommerce settings are configured, including general, products, tax, shipping, payments, accounts and privacy, emails, integrations, and advanced settings like page setups, REST API, etc.

The Status page is a useful for troubleshooting on your own or when contacting support. Download the System Status Report and review, or attach it to your support ticket. It provides an overall snapshot of your setup and potential conflicts.

The Extensions sections is where you can browse for additional free/premium plugins and extensions from WooCommerce.com to add functionality and features to your site. Use the **Discover**, **Browse**, or **Themes** tabs to discover extension to enhance your store with, and manage your subscriptions from the **My Subscriptions**tab.

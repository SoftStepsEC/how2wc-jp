The WooCommerce Customizer allows you to set the general configuration of your product catalog.

This page explains:

- **How to configure** what (products/categories) displays on the shop page.
- **How to configure** what displays on category pages.
- **How to sort products**in a Category.
- **How many products** to show in a single row.
- **How many rows** of products to display on a page.

To edit the product catalog settings, navigate to **Appearance > Customize > WooCommerce > Product Catalog**. The next few sections of this page will explain each of these settings in more detail.

Your **Shop** Page can display **Products, Categories, or both**. We recommend selecting either Products or Categories to help your customers find the products they want to buy quickly. Here’s how you configure the shop page:

1. Select **Products** or **Categories** from the Shop page display dropdown menu.

1. **Preview** your selection on the right side of the screen:

1. Click **Publish** to save and for the settings to go live.

Much like the shop page, **Category** pages can display **Products or Subcategories within a Category, or both**. Again, we recommend selecting only one.

Follow these steps to configure the shop’s category pages:

1. Select **Products** or **Subcategories** from the Category display dropdown.

1. **Preview** your selection on the right side of the screen:

1. Click **Publish** to save and for the settings to go live.

**Default Product Sorting** allows you to control the order in which products are displayed, which influences how products are viewed by default on Shop and Category pages. Visitors still have the option to sort products in a different way, if desired.

**Default sorting (custom ordering + name)** – display products alphabetically by name. Where the product sort order [has been customized](https://woocommerce.com/document/managing-products/feature-filter-and-sort-products/#sorting-products), that custom order is considered first, and alphabetically by name second (if products share the same order positions). In your store, customers will see this as *Default Sorting*.

**Sort by Popularity (sales)** – display products according to amounts sold, from most to least. Customers see *Sort by Popularity*.

**Sort by Average rating** – display products based on average review ratings, from highest to lowest.

**Sort by most recent** – display products in the order they were added to the store, newest to oldest. Customer see *Sort by Latest*.

**Sort by price (asc / desc)** – sort product by price either lowest to highest (asc) or highest to lowest (desc). Customer see either *Sort by price: low to high*, or *Sort by price: high to low*.

In this example, we’ve chosen **Sort by price (asc)** (*Sort by price: low to high*, shown with a ✔), and the customer is about to select to *Sort by newsness*.

To choose a **Default Sort Order**:

1. **Select** an option from the dropdown:

1. **Preview** your selection live. You can be viewing the **Shop** page or a **Category** page.

1. **Publish** to save and go live.

**Products per Row** allows you to choose the number of items that appear in a single row on the **Shop** and **Category** pages.

Be sensitive to:

- Size of a product image
- Space on a computer/laptop, tablet or mobile device

1. **Use arrows** to **increase/decrease** the number of products.

1. **Preview** your selection live. You can be viewing the **Shop** page or a **Category** page.

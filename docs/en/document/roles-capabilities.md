WooCommerce registers two user roles once activated, and grants additional capabilities to the exist **Admin** user role:

- `manage_woocommerce` for WooCommerce Settings
- `view_woocommerce_reports`

People become **Customers** when they register via the checkout or sign-up process.

Customers:

- Have **read access** only for most capacities. This is the equivalent status to a normal blog subscriber.
- Can edit their own**account** **information**.
- View **past/present orders**.

**Shop Manager** is a role you can give someone to manage the shop without making them an Admin. They have all the rights a customer has, and are granted these main capabilities:

- `manage_woocommerce`: Gives shop managers the option to manage all settings within WooCommerce, and create/edit products.
- `view_woocommerce_reports`: Gives them access to all WooCommerce reports.

The **Shop Manager role** has all the capabilities listed at our [WooCommerce GitHub repo](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/blob/ee01d4219282387c2975ef4594677453c1dd7a0e/includes/class-wc-install.php#L1052).

They also have general WordPress editor capabilities.

If you wish to modify roles and capabilities, you can try the plugin [User roles editor – Add, Assign and Switch user roles](https://woocommerce.com/products/user-roles-editor-for-woocommerce/)

You can alternatively use a third-party plugin such as:

- [Capability Manager Enhanced](http://wordpress.org/plugins/capability-manager-enhanced/)
- [Members](http://wordpress.org/plugins/members/)
- [Groups](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/groups/)

However, please note that WooCommerce Support is **not** in a position to offer assistance on third party related issues/requests. This is also mentioned in our [support policy](https://woocommerce.com/support-policy/#what-our-support-service-does-not-cover).

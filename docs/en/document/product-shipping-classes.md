Shipping classes utilize a product classification system to group products of similar type (e.g. bulky products or small items). Shipping classes work with shipping methods, such as [Flat Rate Shipping](https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/flat-rate-shipping/), to provide different rates to different classes or types of products.

For example, with shipping classes and Flat Rate Shipping, it’s possible to create different flat rate costs for different product types, like bulky items and small items.

Shipping classes are used to group products – they cannot be used to directly offer shipping rates to customers. To set up shipping rates, [configure Shipping Zones](https://woocommerce.com/document/setting-up-shipping-zones/), and then [add your shipping class costs](https://woocommerce.com/document/flat-rate-shipping/#section-3) to a shipping method, such as [Flat Rate](https://woocommerce.com/document/flat-rate-shipping/).

1. Go to: **WooCommerce > Settings > Shipping > Classes**.
2. Select the **Add shipping class** button.

1. Fill in the form that appears on your screen. It includes these three fields:
  - **Shipping Class** – This is the name of the shipping class (e.g., Heavy).
  - **Slug** – This is the unique identifier. Leave it blank for automatic generation or input your own (e.g., heavy-packages).
  - **Description** – Provide a brief description to clarify the purpose of this shipping class (e.g., for heavy items that require higher postage).
  
2. Select **Create** to finish.

Edit and delete shipping classes from the same page where you added them, using the edit and delete options located on the right side of the shipping classes. Follow these instructions to either **edit** or **delete** a Shipping Class:

1. Go to **WooCommerce > Settings > Shipping > Classes**.
2. Find the Edit and Delete links on the right side of the shipping classes. You can either:
  - Use the **Delete** link to eliminate the shipping class.
  - Use the **Edit** link to open the **Add shipping class** form and revise the name, slug, or descriptions.
  
3. Use the **Save** button to finish.

Assign shipping classes to individual products you want in a specific class (e.g., bulky or heavy items) to apply shipping rates to that class. **Each product can only have one shipping class assigned to it**. Follow the instructions below to assign shipping classes to individual products:

1. Go to **WooCommerce > Products**.
2. Find the product you want to add a shipping class to and select Edit .
  - **Simple product:** Go to the **Shipping** tab, and select the class you want to assign from the **Shipping class** drop-down menu.
  - **Variable product:**You can set a**Shipping class** for the parent product the same way as you would for a Simple product. You can also set a different **Shipping class** for individual variations on the **Variations**tab, select the variation to update, then select the **Shipping class** you want to assign to that variation from the **Shipping class** drop-down menu.
  
3. **Update** the product to save changes.

If you need to add, update, or change a shipping class for multiple products at once, use the [bulk actions drop-down](https://woocommerce.com/document/bulk-editing-products/) on the **Products** page. Follow these steps to update the shipping class for more than one product at once:

1. Go to **WooCommerce > Products**.
2. **Select the products** you want to edit by ticking boxes on the left-hand side.
3. Select**Edit** from the Bulk actions drop-down, then **Apply** to display the fields available to edit.

1. Select a **Shipping class** from the drop-down.
2. Select **Update** to save changes.

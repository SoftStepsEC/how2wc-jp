WooCommerce.com sells subscriptions to extensions that add niche, complex, or unique functionality, as well as themes that help shape the design and layout of your store.

These are either made by the WooCommerce team or by trusted third-party Marketplace developers. These developers create, maintain, and support their own products.

Marketplace developers, sometimes called Marketplace vendors, are individuals or companies who sell products on WooCommerce.com.

They:

- **Maintain their own product listings**.
- **Improve their products** as WordPress, WooCommerce and the broader ecommerce market evolve.
- **Update their products**in response to customer feedback.
- **Resolve any problems** that may arise regarding their products.
- **Provide support**for customers who have purchased their products. If you log a support request for a product made by a Marketplace developer, you will get a reply directly from them.

[Read our Marketplace overview](https://woocommerce.com/document/marketplace-overview/) to better understand the role of Marketplace developers.

The developer/owner of a product is displayed below the product’s name.

When you log a support request for a specific product, the developer’s name is also displayed below the **Product** drop-down field.

In general, **no personal information about customers is shared with Marketplace Developers**, although they can see aggregate data about the sales of their products.

When a customer logs a support request with a Marketplace developer, we will share some information to help the developer respond to the request, including:

- The customer’s email address, so the developer can respond to the request.
- Which product the email refers to and when the subscription for that product expires.
- The information that the customer shared on the ticket, including their website URL and system status report.

If a customer asks a developer about another product they have purchased in the course of a support interaction, the developer may contact us to confirm the customer has purchased the product. We may then share information about that product subscription with that developer.

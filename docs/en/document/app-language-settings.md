The Woo Mobile App for Android and iOS will use the language set in your device settings.

For example, if your phone or tablet is set to English, the Woo Mobile App will also be in English. If you change the system language to French, the app will update to reflect this change.

The following languages are supported:

- Arabic
- Chinese (China)
- Chinese (Taiwan)
- Dutch
- French
- German
- Hebrew
- Indonesian
- Italian
- Japanese
- Korean
- Portuguese (Brazil)
- Russian
- Spanish
- Swedish
- Turkish

Due to the challenges and cost of creating and maintaining support for additional languages, we are not able to add support for additional languages at this time. This includes community and volunteer translations.

If you’re using the Jetpack plugin to connect the mobile app to your site, ensure that the Jetpack connection is active and functioning correctly. [Review common issues](https://jetpack.com/support/getting-started-with-jetpack/known-issues/) or [reconnect your site](https://jetpack.com/support/reconnecting-reinstalling-jetpack/).

If you’re still having difficulty, contact support from within the app by going to *Menu > Settings > Help & Support > Contact Support*.

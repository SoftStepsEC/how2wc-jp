Thinking about starting an online store on WooCommerce or have already begun building? Well first off, congrats! Woo powers success for millions of merchants around the world, and we hope it’ll do the same for you. Here you’ll find step-by-step instructions on how to build an online store with Woo. We know there are a lot of items to check off your list, so be sure to bookmark this page and return to it as you progress.

WooCommerce is a **plugin** for WordPress. If you’re not familiar with plugins, this means that Woo is software that you add to your WordPress site. Each Woo store is built on a WordPress website.

**Over 43% of the internet** uses WordPress to build and manage their websites, and WooCommerce is the only ecommerce platform built by and for WordPress. Benefits include near-unlimited flexibility; precise controls; and a community of over 5,000 developers, agencies, and creative experts ready to help you build, customize, and grow your online store.

Congrats! You’re getting started with the world’s most flexible ecommerce platform. Here are some of the most popular ways to build a fully customized online store that’s ready to scale with you.

If you’re new to WordPress, we know there’s a lot to learn, and that there are many ways to build an online store with Woo. To get you started, here are a few terms that you’ll see as you work to launch your store.

There are many ways to get help with your WooCommerce store, including self-service articles, our wonderful support team, recommended developers, and our community of Woo users. Here’s an overview of who is able to help with what.

#### Help documents

Our help articles include step-by-step instructions and explanations for all WordPress and WooCommerce features.

- [WooCommerce articles](https://woocommerce.com/documentation/)
- [WordPress articles](https://wordpress.org/documentation/)

#### Woo customer support

If you’re using an extension maintained by Woo, you can [reach out to our dedicated team of Happiness Engineers](https://woocommerce.com/my-account/create-a-ticket/) for assistance.

#### Third-party support

Some extensions are not maintained by Woo, but will still offer their own customer support. Support contact information can be found on the extension product page within [the WooCommerce Marketplace](https://woocommerce.com/products/).

#### Codeable

[Codeable](https://www.codeable.io/partners/woocommerce/?ref=qGefA6) is a vetted group of freelance WordPress developers who can solve one-off challenges like setting up extensions, conflict testing, adding custom code snippets, connecting domains, and more.

#### Woo Agency Partners

The certified agencies in [Woo Agency Partner program](https://partners.woocommerce.com/English/marketplace/) are available to help with larger projects, like migrations, extensive customization, or site creation and maintenance.

#### Woo community forums

The Woo forums are full of experienced merchants and developers who are happy to share tips and answer questions.

The first thing to do before you build an online store is choosing a name for your business. It should be timeless, unique for your niche, and, ideally, communicative of your brand. Need help deciding? Check out the [WordPress business name generator](https://wordpress.com/business-name-generator/) for ideas.

Hosting — how and where you’ll store your website’s information and assets — comes in all shapes and sizes. When you’re just starting out, a low-cost plan that can scale up as you grow will do the job.

For WordPress and WooCommerce, your hosting choice determines how you build a site with the platform.

#### Managed hosting

Managed hosting is where a company handles hosting your online store for you, including software installation, updates, etc. This simplified process doesn’t require any manual connections or downloads to get your website up and running. [WordPress.com offers excellent managed WooCommerce hosting](https://wordpress.com/ecommerce/?irclickid=RuAQVtTvzxycW35zVEwSUQ%3AfUkpR0XXO-19eT00&sharedid=Hosting-WPCOM&irpid=6490792&utm_source=impact&utm_medium=affiliate&irgwc=1&afsrc=1&ref=woo-getting-started-docs) so you can get started with your store right away

#### Self hosting

Self-hosting your website means that you have to find hosting for your site through a third party, [such as Bluehost or SiteGround](https://woocommerce.com/hosting-solutions/). Once you find your hosting provider, you’ll install WordPress (from wordpress.org) onto your web host. Then, you’ll download the WooCommerce plugin and add it to your WordPress site.

Want to learn more about hosting? Check out this in-depth article on managed vs. self-hosting.

Now that your hosting is ready, it’s time to create your online store!

Migrating? Check out our articles under [Migrating to WooCommerce](https://woocommerce.com/documentation/woocommerce/getting-started/migrating-to-woocommerce/)

Once Woo is installed, a [Setup Wizard](https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-setup-wizard/) will display on your WordPress dashboard. The first step is the store profiler, which prompts you to add details like location, industry, and product types.

Then, the Setup Wizard will take you through your Store Setup Checklist. It asks for information about your products, payments, taxes, shipping, and marketing tools in order to provide relevant recommendations for customizing your store. We’ll go through each of these steps below.

Want more? Check out our article: [Installation & Updating](https://woocommerce.com/document/installing-uninstalling-woocommerce/)

The Store Setup Checklist will show a list of the most important tasks you need to get your store up and running. First up is [adding your products](https://woocommerce.com/document/managing-products/). Read through the section below to understand whether or not you’ll need additional capabilities for your store.

#### Product types

Anything you sell with WooCommerce is considered a product. And you can sell (almost) anything with WooCommerce — one of the many benefits of working with an open-source platform.

You may choose to sell several different product types on your store. With Woo, you’ll be able to set up six different product types right out of the box:

**Simple**

Physical goods offered as a [single option](https://woocommerce.com/document/managing-products/add-product/#adding-a-simple-product), such as a pottery item or adoptable cat.

**Variable**

Physical goods that offer [options](https://woocommerce.com/document/variable-product/) like size or color. These items often have different SKUs.

**Grouped**

A set of simple products that are [purchased together](https://woocommerce.com/document/managing-products/add-product/#adding-a-grouped-product), such as a set of drinking glasses.

**Virtual**

Products (like services) that don’t require shipping. This [product type](https://woocommerce.com/document/managing-products/virtual-downloadable/) will disable shipping fields in the product listing and at checkout.

**Downloadable**

[Digital offerings](https://woocommerce.com/document/digital-downloadable-product-handling/#creating-downloadable-products) like magazines or ebooks. Customers are sent a file as a link in their order notification email.

**External or Affiliate**

Products that [can be listed](https://woocommerce.com/document/managing-products/add-product/#adding-an-external-affiliate-product) on your site even though they’re sold elsewhere, such as on a marketplace or third-party retailer.

Other product types can be set up with free or paid extensions available in the [WooCommerce Marketplace](https://woocommerce.com/products/):

**Subscriptions**

With [WooCommerce Subscriptions](https://woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-subscriptions/), you can create and manage products with recurring payments for physical or digital products and services.

**Memberships**

[WooCommerce Memberships](https://woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-memberships/) allows you to restrict premium content products, or discounts to members.

**Bundles**

[Product Bundles](https://woocommerce.com/products/product-bundles/)allows you to offer related groups of products, personalization, and assembled products. This increases upsell and order value.

**Courses**

With [Sensei Pro](https://woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-paid-courses/), you can sell online courses with complete learning management options — including quizzes, certificates, content drips, and more.

**Bookings**

Allow customers to book appointments, make reservations or rent equipment all on your online store with [WooCommerce Bookings](https://woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-bookings/).

Here’s a quick overview of how to add a product, manage its inventory and pricing, add product data and images, and publish it for sale.

![Here’s a quick overview of how to add a product, manage its inventory and pricing, add product data ](docs/images/883bcd2f56af4e919e2714971afb163f.jpg "https://fast.wistia.com/embed/medias/gc2gprpl74/swatch")

Need more information? Read our article on how to set up your products.

#### Categories, tags, and attributes

[Categories, tags, and attributes](https://woocommerce.com/document/managing-product-taxonomies/) let you organize your products so customers can find exactly what they’re looking for on your store, and can help increase order value by showing groups of related products.

**Product categories** and tags can be created, edited, and applied at any time — either when you first create a product, or later on. In WooCommerce, you can also add **product attributes**, which include details like color, size, material, use, and more. **Tags** are another way to relate products to each other. For example, you might want to allow customers to search for or filter all products that have a cat on them.

Get more information on setting up product categories, tags, and attributes.

In this step, you can select and activate one or more options to accept payments on your store.

The best payment providers for your store depends on where you live, where you’d like to sell your products, and what you sell. We recommend setting up [WooPayments](https://woocommerce.com/products/woopayments/), which includes credit card processing and a variety of payment methods. [Check to see if WooPayments is available in your country.](https://woocommerce.com/document/woopayments/compatibility/countries/) If it is, take the [next step](https://woocommerce.com/document/woopayments/startup-guide/) and get started today!

#### Card payment processors

Card payment processors such as [Stripe](https://woocommerce.com/products/stripe/?quid=f1690ecaa8bba2728f7f6bbb05b18781), [Square](https://woocommerce.com/products/square/?quid=f1690ecaa8bba2728f7f6bbb05b18781), or [Viva Wallet](https://woocommerce.com/products/viva-wallet-for-woocommerce/?quid=320fc0a533d90c502b3cbeca278e9d92) allow customers to pay with credit or debit cards.

[](https://woocommerce.com/product-category/woocommerce-extensions/payment-gateways/?categoryIds=28680&collections=product&page=1) [Browse all of our payment processor and gateway options](https://woocommerce.com/product-category/woocommerce-extensions/payment-gateways/?categoryIds=28680&collections=product&page=1).

#### Alternative payment providers

Alternative payment methods like [PayPal](https://woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-paypal-payments/?quid=d58714a938c2fb81b6962e00aa606598) or [Amazon Pay](https://woocommerce.com/products/pay-with-amazon/?quid=320fc0a533d90c502b3cbeca278e9d92) allow customers to pay with accounts that they’ve already set up on other platforms. This can boost customer trust and streamline the checkout process, because they won’t have to re-enter their payment information.

[](https://woocommerce.com/product-category/woocommerce-extensions/payment-gateways/?categoryIds=28682&collections=product&page=1) [Browse all of our alternative payment providers](https://woocommerce.com/product-category/woocommerce-extensions/payment-gateways/?categoryIds=28682&collections=product&page=1).

#### Buy now, pay later

Adding a buy now, pay later (BNPL) option like [Afterpay](https://woocommerce.com/vendor/afterpay), [Affirm](https://woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-gateway-affirm/), or [Klarna](https://woocommerce.com/products/klarna-payments/?quid=d58714a938c2fb81b6962e00aa606598) is helpful for customers who would rather make several payments toward their purchase. BNPL options are growing in popularity, with [Bankrate projecting](https://www.bankrate.com/loans/personal-loans/buy-now-pay-later-statistics/) a 290% increase in consumer spending with this option by 2027.

[](https://woocommerce.com/product-category/woocommerce-extensions/payment-gateways/?categoryIds=28682&collections=product&page=1) [Browse all of our buy now, pay later options](https://woocommerce.com/product-category/woocommerce-extensions/payment-gateways/?categoryIds=28682&collections=product&page=1).

#### Crypto payments

If you’re selling to a tech-forward audience, you can also enable crypto payments with extensions from [Coinbase](https://woocommerce.com/products/coinbase-commerce/?quid=eb132a4a2ea1052f5efa904757f5e6c5), [HAYVN](https://woocommerce.com/products/hayvn-pay/?quid=eb132a4a2ea1052f5efa904757f5e6c5), and [others](https://woocommerce.com/product-category/woocommerce-extensions/payment-gateways/crypto-payments/?categoryIds=31694&collections=product&page=1). Crypto payment solutions also work alongside WooPayments.

#### The cost of payments

Most payment processors and providers are paid for with a per-transaction fee, which covers the cost of processing each payment. [Learn more about the fees for WooPayments.](https://woocommerce.com/document/woopayments/fees-and-debits/fees/)

Some providers charge a combination of a percentage of the sale plus a flat fee for each transaction. For example, you might see a rate of 2.9% + $0.30 — that means if a customer bought an order for $100 from your online store, the total processing fee for that order would be $3.20.

These rates vary between payment providers, so it’s important to research a few options before making your choice.

#### Video: Setting up WooPayments

Here’s a quick overview of how to set up WooPayments. You’ll also learn how to enable multiple payment methods on your website, which will cater to a wider audience and increase your checkout conversion.

Check out all payment extensions in the Woo Marketplace and see what’s available for your store.

Collecting taxes for your sales may seem a little scary, but we aim to make the setup as straightforward as possible. While we can help answer questions about configuring your settings to handle taxes, we do not provide tax, legal, or accounting advice. You should always consult a tax professional for specific advice related to your transactions.

With Woo, you have four options for setting up your taxes: [WooCommerce Tax](https://woocommerce.com/products/tax/), [Avalara AvaTax](https://woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-avatax/), [manual setup](https://woocommerce.com/document/setting-up-taxes-in-woocommerce/), or bypassing sales tax if you’re exempt.

Tax rates vary according to your customers’ locations and can be complex. If you have only one tax nexus, WooCommerce Tax is a great choice and offers automated sales tax for a growing list of countries. [Check here to see if your location is included.](https://woocommerce.com/products/tax/)

For a complete guide to setting up your taxes in WooCommerce, please visit our tax article.

Here’s a quick overview of how to set up tax rates with WooCommerce Tax. You’ll need to install [Jetpack](https://woocommerce.com/products/jetpack/), a free WordPress plugin, before using this extension.

![Here’s a quick overview of how to set up tax rates with WooCommerce Tax](docs/images/3d29593acd9c5145772ce86b0fa1de96.jpg "https://fast.wistia.com/embed/medias/q3i9ypzo8e/swatch")

If you sell physical products, you’ll want to make sure they make it safely to your customers. With Woo, you can set variable shipping rates based on where your products are going. If you’re located in the U.S., install [WooCommerce Shipping](https://woocommerce.com/woocommerce-shipping/) for convenient label printing and shipping discounts.

If WooCommerce Shipping doesn’t meet your needs, [we have a number of other shipping extensions available in the Woo Marketplace.](https://woocommerce.com/product-category/woocommerce-extensions/shipping-delivery-and-fulfillment/?categoryIds=28685&collections=product&page=1) You can find information about configuring shipping extensions and setting up shipping zones and classes in our [documentation.](https://woocommerce.com/documentation/plugins/woocommerce/getting-started/shipping/)

Once your shipping is set up, you’ll be able to configure options for variable rates and local pickup.

This quick overview will teach you how to set up shipping based on your store’s location and shipping preferences.

Most companies consider a breach of security not a matter of *if*it will happen — but *when*. And that threat is no different for small businesses. To keep your site and customer information secure, it’s important to have at least a few protective measures in order:

1. Host with a secure, reputable provider.
2. Have an SSL (secure socket layer) certificate for your website.
3. Use trusted plugins and extensions.
4. Make sure everything is up to date on your WordPress site.
5. Use a secure username and password.
6. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) for site administrators.
7. Set up a spam filter, like [Jetpack Akismet](https://jetpack.com/upgrade/anti-spam/).
8. Regularly back up your website.

You can achieve all of this — and implement additional protection — with Jetpack. [Learn more about keeping your Woo store secure](https://jetpack.com/blog/how-to-secure-your-woocommerce-store/).

Here are a few things to think about as you’re getting started.

#### Pick a theme

Your website theme dictates your online store’s appearance. When you install Woo, you’ll automatically be set up with the default theme. You can change this at any time.

To change your theme, look through the [Marketplace](https://woocommerce.com/product-category/themes?categoryIds=1033&collections=theme&page=1) and check out the demo sites.

One thing to keep in mind: changing your theme can be a complex process as you add more content and products to your site. We recommend adding a backup service like [Jetpack VaultPress Backup](https://woocommerce.com/products/jetpack-backup/) to save your data at regular intervals. That way, if your site ever breaks after a change, you can restore a previous version from one of your backups.

#### Add your logo

Your customers will come to recognize your brand and products by your logo. Think of it as your first impression and part of your brand voice.

We know it can be difficult to justify the cost of a custom logo, so WordPress has partnered with fiverr to develop a [logo maker to get you started.](https://wordpress.com/logo-maker/) As your business grows, consider working with an experienced graphic designer to build out a professional logo and brand identity.

#### Create your main menu

Even the newest businesses need to have a few standard pages that customers will expect. This includes a homepage, Shop, About Us, Contact, and a page for your store’s shipping and privacy policies. Each of these should be clearly labeled and easy to find.

On most websites, you’ll notice that the key pages listed above can be accessed from multiple locations. This often includes a main menu, found near the top of any given page; a footer menu, found at the bottom of each page; and sometimes an expandable or sidebar menu.

Stores with subcategories and a large number of products might also use breadcrumbs, which show the path of links or categories the customer clicked through to reach the current page.

You’ve built your store; now it’s time to spread the word. You can find helpful information about specific marketing tools in our Marketplace, including:

- [AutomateWoo](https://woocommerce.com/products/automatewoo/)
- [MailPoet](https://woocommerce.com/products/mailpoet/)
- [Google Analytics](https://woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-google-analytics/)
- [Google for WooCommerce](https://woocommerce.com/products/google-listings-and-ads)
- [Facebook](https://woocommerce.com/products/facebook/)
- [Instagram](https://woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-instagram/)
- [Pinterest](https://woocommerce.com/products/pinterest-for-woocommerce/?quid=72d25bc2dc8d697aa237811b4e3626c8)
- [TikTok](https://woocommerce.com/products/tiktok-for-woocommerce/?quid=5278e508bad7ef13f5f5d8705d089c4a)
- [Trustpilot](https://woocommerce.com/products/trustpilot-reviews/?quid=72d25bc2dc8d697aa237811b4e3626c8)

Choosing the right marketing channels can take time. To get started, think about where your target audience is most likely to be and focus on those channels first.

Here’s a quick overview of how to add recommended marketing tools to your store.

![Here’s a quick overview of how to add recommended marketing tools to your store](docs/images/f2b651daf1abb1b70630314c85ed87c7.jpg "https://fast.wistia.com/embed/medias/fxydsaivnc/swatch")

#### Store management

Once you complete the Store Setup Checklist, it will be replaced by a store management widget. This will present options for growing and further personalizing your store, such as adding more products or adjusting shipping, tax, or payment settings.

#### Site speed

As you add more extensions and plugins to your site, you may notice a delay in the time it takes pages and their content to load. How quickly your pages load is known as site speed, and it’s an extremely important part of providing a great customer experience. Potential customers will often navigate away from a site if it doesn’t load fast enough, so don’t neglect this aspect of your business. [Jetpack Boost](https://jetpack.com/boost/) is a great option to get you started.

As your business grows, keep your site speed in mind. [Here are ten ways to speed up your online store.](https://woocommerce.com/posts/ten-ways-to-speed-up-your-woocommerce-store/)

If you’ve worked through all of these steps, congratulations! Launch day is a serious accomplishment, and we’re so excited that you’ve made it happen with Woo.

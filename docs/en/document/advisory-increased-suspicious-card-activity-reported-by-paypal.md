PayPal has recently informed us of increased suspicious card activity affecting merchants across the market.

This notice is to help WooCommerce stores understand the situation, take the appropriate security steps, and ensure that checkout flows remain protected.

This advisory applies specifically to stores using the [PayPal Payments plugin](https://woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-paypal-payments/) and PayPal’s built-in fraud-prevention features. WooCommerce stores using PayPal Payments may need to update their settings or upgrade to the latest plugin version to benefit from PayPal’s fraud-prevention tools, including PayPal’s CAPTCHA feature.

Your store’s security is our priority, and we recommend reviewing the information below.

PayPal has detected a rise in suspicious card activity occurring across the broader market. As part of PayPal’s recommended security practices, certain fraud-prevention tools within the PayPal Payments plugin – including PayPal’s CAPTCHA – can help reduce risk during checkout.

Depending on which version of the PayPal Payments plugin you are currently using, the steps you need to take may differ.

You may see the following in-product notice:

> PayPal detected increased suspicious card activity in market. Please enable fraud protection in your PayPal Payment settings by enabling CAPTCHA for PayPal Payments.

To To help protect your store:

- Enable PayPal’s fraud protection features by turning on CAPTCHA for [PayPal Payments](https://woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-paypal-payment)

You will receive a notice after the next plugin update is released:

> PayPal Payments v3.3.0+ includes important fraud management features. Please update your PayPal Payment plugin to the latest version to help keep your checkout secure.

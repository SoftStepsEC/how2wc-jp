To get support for issues and questions you might have, there are two paths:

- **Use our self-serve resources to help yourself**. Many issues can be solved right away using [our AI Assistant](https://woocommerce.com/document/how-to-get-help/#chat-with-our-ai-assistant), then you need not wait for a reply from a human, no matter how fast our Happiness Engineers are.
- **Contact our Help Desk**. It greatly speeds up the process if you give us as much information as possible: Things like your WooCommerce [System Status Report](https://woocommerce.com/document/understanding-the-woocommerce-system-status-report/), a [screenshot](https://wordpress.com/support/make-a-screenshot/) of the error, any relevant [PHP error logs](https://woocommerce.com/document/finding-php-error-logs/) and more as outlined below.

On each page of our documentation, as well as on the [Get Support page](https://woocommerce.com/my-account/contact-support/) of your account area, we have a WooCommerce specialist AI Assistant with access to all the documentation on WooCommerce.com, which is purpose-built to help you find solutions quickly.

If your site is [Jetpack-connected](https://woocommerce.com/document/jetpack-setup-instructions-for-the-woocommerce-mobile-app/), our AI assistant can view select details about your site, such as whether plugins need updating and which plugins you have installed. If you have [usage tracking](https://woocommerce.com/usage-tracking/) enabled in WooCommerce and your site has experienced any recent fatal errors, the AI assistant can display a readout of the errors and assist you in diagnosing issues with your store.

If you choose not to enable usage tracking or connect your site to Jetpack, sharing your system status report, error logs, or descriptions of issues you’re facing with the assistant can yield impressive results.

Enter your question in the search box above, or use your favorite search engine to research a solution.

To ensure you have the latest version of the software powering your site (WordPress, plugins, and themes), go to the **Dashboard > Updates**menu to see if anything needs to be updated.

To provide the most efficient support possible, update your theme and plugins**BEFORE**contacting support.

**Update Notifications**

If you purchased a WooCommerce product, you must activate your WooCommerce subscription as described in [Managing WooCommerce.com Subscriptions](https://woocommerce.com/document/managing-woocommerce-com-subscriptions/) to update the extension. *This is only necessary for products downloaded from WooCommerce.com (paid or free).*

To properly troubleshoot an issue, we need to rule out theme or plugin conflicts.

1. **Enable** a default WordPress theme, such as our own [Storefront](https://woocommerce.com/products/storefront). If the issue stops, there is a conflict with your theme. Contact the theme developer for assistance.
2. **Deactivate** temporarily all plugins except WooCommerce and the plugin presenting issues. Reactivate plugins one by one and repeat the same actions you took when the issue arose to find the one causing conflict. More at: [How to Test for Conflicts](https://woocommerce.com/document/how-to-test-for-conflicts/).
3. **Contact** us if the issue persists and is related to a WooCommerce.com product.

Third-party (non-WooCommerce.com purchased) themes or plugins are supported by the maker, and you must contact the developer directly. We only support products we create and offer on WooCommerce.com.

Do you still have questions and need assistance?

This documentation is about the free, [core WooCommerce plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce/), for which support is provided in our [community forums on WordPress.org](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/woocommerce). By searching this forum, you’ll often find that your question has been asked and answered before. If you haven’t created a WordPress.org account to use the forums, [here’s how](https://make.wordpress.org/contribute/join/).

- If you’re looking to **extend** the core functionality shown here, we recommend reviewing available extensions in the [WooCommerce Marketplace](https://woocommerce.com/products/).
- Need ongoing advanced support or a **customization** built for WooCommerce? Hire a [Woo Agency Partner](https://woocommerce.com/customizations/).
- Are you a **developer** building your own WooCommerce integration or extension? Check our [Developer Resources](https://developer.woocommerce.com/).

If you weren’t able to find the information you need, please use the feedback thumbs below to let us know.

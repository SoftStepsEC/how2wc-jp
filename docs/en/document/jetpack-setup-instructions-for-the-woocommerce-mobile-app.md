Once you’ve installed the WooCommerce Mobile App, you can **access additional features** — such as stats and push notifications for new orders — by connecting your store to Jetpack.

1. Log in to your site’s WP Admin dashboard on your computer.
2. In the left-hand menu, hover over **Plugins** and click **Add New Plugin**.
3. In the **Search Plugins** field, type *Jetpack*. The page should automatically refresh, displaying **Jetpack – WP Security, Backup, Speed, & Growth** by Automattic as the first item.
4. Click **Install Now**.

1. Once Jetpack is installed, click the**Activate**button; you’ll be taken to the activation screen at *Jetpack > My Jetpack*. [](https://woocommerce.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/activate-jetpack-plugin-wp-admin@2x.png)
2. Click the **Activate Jetpack in one click** button. [](https://woocommerce.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/activate-jetpack-one-click-wp-admin@2x.png)
3. Once Jetpack is activated, you can **choose a paid plan** or scroll to the bottom of the page and click the **Start with Jetpack Free** button. [](https://woocommerce.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/activated-jetpack-start-for-free@2x.png)

**Note:** If you see a different screen when selecting *Jetpack*, your site is likely already connected. If you do not see *My Jetpack* your site is likely hosted with WordPress.com and connected automatically. If you do see My Jetpack, you can scroll to the bottom of the page and check under *Connection* to see what account is currently connected.

1. Back in your WP Admin dashboard, navigate to *Jetpack > My Jetpack,* and click **Connect your user account**. [](https://woocommerce.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/connect-jetpacl-user-account-wp-admin-red@2x.png?w=1344)
2. Jetpack requires a [WordPress.com account](https://woocommerce.com/document/what-is-a-wordpress-com-account/) to work. If you’re not signed in to WordPress.com, you’ll be prompted to do so or [create a new account](https://wordpress.com/start/wpcc/oauth2-user?oauth2_client_id=50916&oauth2_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fpublic-api.wordpress.com%2Foauth2%2Fauthorize%2F%3Fresponse_type%3Dcode%26client_id%3D50916%26state%3D61000fd1ba08f6ea599653ec7c619283f59f00f7bc7033a647a796c025658ef7%26redirect_uri%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwoocommerce.com%252Fwc-api%252Fwpcom-signin%253Fnext%253D%25252F%26blog_id%3D0%26wpcom_connect%3D1%26wccom-from%26calypso_env%3Dproduction%26from-calypso%3D1&woo-passwordless=yes). (You’ll use this account to sign in to the Woo Mobile App later.)
3. Click **Approve**; the connection process should only take a few seconds.

1. Once your account is connected, you can **choose a paid plan** or scroll to the bottom of the page and click the **Start with Jetpack Free** button. [](https://woocommerce.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/activated-jetpack-start-for-free@2x.png)

Open the app on your mobile device, enter your site address (URL), and **sign in** using your WordPress.com username and password. That’s it!

If you have more than one store connected to Jetpack and your WordPress.com account, you will see them in the app’s **connected store list** once logged in.

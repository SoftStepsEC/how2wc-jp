Several widgets come with WooCommerce that help you display products in a multitude of ways in your themes widgetized areas. Although, in modern themes, adding WooCommerce Blocks to widget areas is a more versatile and flexible approach.

The default included widgets below, now referred to as Legacy Widgets, are still available to add to your theme’s widget areas. The widget icon is a quick way to differentiates widgets from similarly-named blocks.

The four default widgets are:

- **Cart**— a summary showing what’s in the cart.
- **Products list —** a limited list of all, featured, or on-sale products.
- **Products by Rating list**— a list of your store’s top-rated products.
- **Recently Viewed Products list**— a list of a customer’s recently viewed products.

There’s also a growing list of more flexible and powerful WooCommerce Blocks that can be added in addition to or instead of the widgets above. Check out [WooCommerce Blocks](https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-blocks/) for more details about what’s available and what they can do.

Options for where to play your widgets can be found under **Appearance > Widgets**, but what’s available to you depends on the active theme on your site. As an example, the areas below are available with [Storefront Theme](https://woocommerce.com/products/storefront/). Select a location, and then click the **plus sign** to find and add a widget or block.

Several widgets have been converted into blocks. Blocks provide more customization options for merchants and offer a better user experience to shoppers.

In order to transform existing widgets into blocks, click on the block icon to open the*Transform to*menu. From the available options, select the equivalent block:

The WooCommerce Customizer includes a couple different display settings for the Product Page and Product images. On this page you’ll learn how to:

- Configure the Sticky Add-to-Cart and Product Pagination features for single product pages.
- Configure product thumbnail sizes and cropping.

The WooCommerce Customizer lets you choose how to display product pages. Navigate to **Appearance > Customize > WooCommerce > Product Page,** and you’ll find two display options for the product page:

This is a small bar at the top of your browser window that includes relevant product information like the thumbnail, product title, price and the ever important Add to cart button. It comes into view once the standard Add to cart button has gone out of view in your browser window.

This option displays the **next** and **previous** product links on product pages by displaying a thumbnail image. Hovering on the thumbnail reveals the product name/title.

The next menu item in the customizer is **Product Images**. Here, you set the size and cropping of**Catalog** and **Thumbnail** images.

First, let’s go over the different types of images that appear on a WooCommerce store:

- **Catalog Images** are medium-sized images on the Shop page, Category pages, and for Related products, Up-sells, and Cross-sells. The WooCommerce Customizer settings described below set the size and cropping for these images.
- **Thumbnail Images** are the smallest images used in the Cart, Widgets, and (optional) Gallery images underneath the Single Product Image on individual product details pages. The WooCommerce Customizer settings described below set the size and cropping for these images.
- **Single Product Image** is the largest image and refers to the main/featured image. Product Image settings in WooCommerce Customizer **do not** apply to these. To add, edit, or delete the Single Product Image or Product Image Gallery, see [Adding Product Images and Galleries](https://woocommerce.com/document/adding-product-images-and-galleries/).

Using the WooCommerce Customizer, you can resize and crop thumbnail images. Follow the instructions below to choose thumbnail cropping options:

1. Go to: **Appearance > Customize > WooCommerce > Product Images**.
2. Select one of the following cropping options:
  - **1:1**— Square Images. All images appear as 1:1 squares.
  - **Custom —**Enter a ratio for image cropping.****In this example, the set ratio is 1:2. Notice that one image is not large enough to fit the selected ratio.
  - **Uncropped —**Images appear as is, which can result in images appearing non uniformly.
  
3. Test on different devices.
  - At the bottom of the Customizer you’ll see 3 icons for Desktop, Tablet, and Mobile. Use those to preview your changes across device sizes.
  
4. Select **Publish** to save and make your changes live.

**Note:**

If you need to regenerate thumbnails on your site, say when troubleshooting image changes or if you move to use a new theme. You can use the Regenerate Shop Thumbnails option at **WooCommerce > Status > Tools**:

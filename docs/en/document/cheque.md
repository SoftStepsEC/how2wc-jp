Check payments is a payment gateway that lets customers make payments without needing to do it online.

Until payment clears outside of WooCommerce (requiring the store owner to manually check their bank account), orders using Check payments remain in “on hold” status. You, as the store owner, should confirm that payments have cleared in your bank account before processing orders in WooCommerce. **Before** shipping an order and marking it as**Processing** or **Completed**, it’s important to verify that you’ve been paid/the transaction has cleared and is in your account. For more information, see [Managing Orders](https://woocommerce.com/document/managing-orders/).

This page will take you through the steps to activate and configure Check payments on your store.

*Note: Check Payments was formerly called ‘Cheque’ prior to WooCommerce 3.3.*

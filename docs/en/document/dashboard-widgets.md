The WordPress dashboard is typically the first thing you see after logging in. Upon activation, WooCommerce will add two dashboard widgets giving you access to an overview of your store. If you’re using WordPress Multisite with multiple stores, a third widget will be added to the main site.

To customize the widgets displayed on the dashboard, select “**Screen Options**” in the upper right corner of the screen to open the **Screen elements** panel. The options displayed here depend on what plugins you have installed, what page you’re on, whether multisite is enabled, and even what hosting company you’re using.

If you haven’t completed the WooCommerce Setup Wizard, you’ll see the WooCommerce Setup widget on the dashboard as a reminder to configure necessary store settings. Once the WooCommerce Setup Wizard is completed, the WooCommerce Status and WooCommerce Recent Reviews widgets will show and be available in the screen options panel.

The **WooCommerce Status** widget gives you a quick overview of your store. It starts with the total net sales for the current month, then shows your top-selling product. Finally, you have a grid of your order and stock statuses.

It will show if you have orders waiting to be processed or on-hold. It will also show the number of products running low on stock or completely out of stock.

**Note:**

When the [WooCommerce Setup Wizard](https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-setup-wizard/) isn’t completed, the **WooCommerce Status** widget will not appear. Instead, you’ll see the **WooCommerce Setup** widget.

The **WooCommerce Recent Reviews** widget shows your store’s most recent reviews.

Each review entry will display the following information:

- Reviewer’s [Gravatar](http://en.gravatar.com/support/what-is-gravatar/), if they have one. If not, the **Default Avatar** selected on **Settings > Discussion** will be shown.
- Product link
- Name of reviewer
- Short snippet of review
- Five-star rating

The WooCommerce Network Orders widget provides order information from across all sites in your network. Each order number is linked to the order details screen on the specific subsite.

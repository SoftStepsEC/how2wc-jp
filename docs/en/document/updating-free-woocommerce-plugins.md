Free WooCommerce extensions or plugins do not require an active subscription to get updates.

You may see subscriptions for free extensions or plugins listed in your store’s WP Admin dashboard at *WooCommerce > Extensions > My subscriptions*. However, they will **not** have a toggle to activate a subscription.

To update these free extensions/plugins via WP Admin, navigate to *Plugins* and [update them](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/manage-plugins/#updating-plugins) manually or automatically.

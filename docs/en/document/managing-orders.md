Orders are the center of activity in your store. Understanding how to manage them effectively is key to keeping your business running smoothly.

The following documentation is your guide to managing orders in WooCommerce. It is designed to assist administrators and shop managers in navigating through the various aspects of order management.

Orders are visible to users with *Admin* or *Shop Manager* roles. Orders are usually created when a customer on your site completes the checkout process, though you can manually add orders from your store’s WP Admin dashboard as well.

The following pages of documentation cover:

- [Order statuses](https://woocommerce.com/document/managing-orders/order-statuses/)
- [Orders overview screen and bulk order management](https://woocommerce.com/document/managing-orders/overview-and-bulk-management/)
- [Single order page and manually adding an order](https://woocommerce.com/document/managing-orders/view-edit-or-add-an-order/)
- [Paying for orders](https://woocommerce.com/document/managing-orders/paying-for-orders/)
- [Removing personal data from orders](https://woocommerce.com/document/managing-orders/removing-personal-data-from-orders/)
- [Testing orders](https://woocommerce.com/document/managing-orders/testing-orders/)
- [Troubleshooting orders](https://woocommerce.com/document/managing-orders/troubleshooting-orders/)

**Note:**Orders can also be created via external systems that integrate with your site via the [WooCommerce REST API](https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-rest-api/). Creating and managing orders via the REST API is beyond the scope of our merchant documentation. We have separate [technical documentation for the REST API](https://woocommerce.github.io/woocommerce-rest-api-docs/).

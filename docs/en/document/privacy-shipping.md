To take advantage of real-time shipping rates, fulfill orders, and track shipments, certain shipping-related information about you and your customers — including shopping carts, orders, and the configuration of your site — will be passed to the respective service.

We recommend that store owners disclose that they are sharing information with shipping providers in their privacy policy.

This documentation outlines which data is stored and shared with shipping providers when a WooCommerce site uses a [shipping extension offered on WooCommerce.com](https://woocommerce.com/product-category/woocommerce-extensions/shipping-delivery-and-fulfillment/fulfillment-and-dropshipping/?categoryIds=28685&collections=product&page=1). When using a shipping extension, you are **not** sharing this information with WooCommerce.com.

Depending on which settings are enabled and which additional plugins/extensions are used, the specific information shared by your store will vary. We recommend consulting with a lawyer when deciding which information to disclose in your store’s privacy policy.

This includes WooCommerce Shipping and third-party shipping, delivery, and fulfillment carriers offered on WooCommerce.com.

WooCommerce Shipping requires Jetpack to connect with other services to provide live shipping rates, discounted labels, and more. [See which data Jetpack syncs](https://jetpack.com/support/what-data-does-jetpack-sync/#woocommerce-services).

#### Which data is collected

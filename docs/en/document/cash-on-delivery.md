Cash on Delivery (COD) is a payment gateway that lets you take payments at the time of delivery of your customer’s ordered products. WooCommerce sets orders using Cash on Delivery (COD) to “Processing” until payment is collected.

You, as the store owner, should confirm that payments for Cash on Delivery orders have been collected before setting orders to “Complete” in WooCommerce. If you are using the WooCommerce mobile app and a card reader to collect [In-Person Payments](https://woocommerce.com/in-person-payments/), it marks orders “Complete” automatically at the time of payment. For more information see [Managing Orders](https://woocommerce.com/document/managing-orders/).
